Its organisation into differentiated organs, tissues and cells that all have differing functions must be well organised and coordinated to function smoothly. With over 21 000 genes and even more gene products (e.g. proteins with various functions) in 1013 cells, the human body represents an extremely complex network that even today, in the age of molecular biology and genomics, is only partly explored and understood. If elements in this regulatory network are missing or are not performing optimally, because of genetic (inherited gene defects; acquired mutations) or environmental influences (such as infections by parasites, bacteria, fungi or viruses; accidents causing wounds, burns, etc.; toxins from diet that modulate the activity and function of proteins in the body), then health disorders or disturbances result. Stress can also lead to mental and physical illnesses. Health disorders can be treated in various ways. If the cause is known, then a causal treatment becomes possible (e.g. elimination of infecting bacteria with antibiotics). In many cases, disorders are so complex that only a symptomatic treatment is available, relieving pain or discomfort, thus improving quality of life. For most disorders and disturbances, potent and specific medicines are available, mostly of synthetic origin. These therapeutics are usually powerful, but very often exhibit a number of undesired side-effects. Some active plant ingredients, such as alkaloids and cardiac glycosides, also act selectively. They are gen- erally used as isolated single substances similar to synthetic drugs. Herbal medicines, which are used as phytotherapeutics, consist of complex combinations of secondary metabolites from different classes of compounds, the individual components of which can be additive or even synergistic. Therapeutics derived from plants are usually less specific; they can affect more than one molecular target. The most important target structures are proteins, among others enzymes, receptors, transporters, transcription factors, struc- tural proteins, cytoskeleton and motor proteins. Sometimes biomembranes and membrane proteins, or the DNA and related processes (replication, transcription, repair) are the target structures. Polyphenols are found in many medicinal plants, interacting with proteins via hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds and altering their spatial structure. In addition, lipophilic or amphiphilic active substances are widely distributed in the classes of terpenes or lipids; they interact with biomembranes and membrane proteins. These multi-target properties can be helpful in complex disorders in which the exact causes are not known. Furthermore, in many diseases, more than one target is affected. Phytomedicine is not the first choice to treat severe and life-threatening diseases, but can be useful in many other instances. The following list of indications should provide an overview of those conditions for which phytomedicine plays a relevant role. Emphasis is placed on those medicinal plants for which clinical trials are available, but a selection of other drugs used in traditional medicine is also included. Refer to the monographs for more information. Note that this compilation is not intended as a recipe for self-treatment. In case of a health disorder, the reader is advised to see a health care professional first for a proper diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is established, then phytotherapy can be considered as an alternative or supportive treatment, if appropriate. Heart and circulation In the case of heart diseases, a distinction is made between heart insufficiency (cardiac insufficiency), heart rhythm disturbance (cardiac arrhythmia), and functional heart complaints. Complaints related to blood circulation include hypertension, hypotension and circulatory disorders (such as peripheral veno-occlusive arterial disease). Heart insufficiency Heart insufficiency results from an inability of the heart muscle to supply the body with adequate amounts of blood. If the heart is no longer well supplied with oxygen-rich blood, because coronary blood vessels are blocked or become narrow because of arteriosclerosis or are weakened by infections, its pumping ability is reduced. Symptoms are dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), fatigue, tachycardia, nycturia, oedema and cyanosis. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) has published a scale with four stages describing the severity of 382 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 382 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM this disorder: NYHA I and II – complaints under physical activity; NYHA III and IV – complaints under modest activity or when at rest. treatment A causal therapy cannot be achieved with phytomedicines. Symptomatic treatment depends on the degree of heart insufficiency. According to the NYHA scale stages III and IV are treated with isolated cardiac glycosides, which inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase. In response, the concentration of Na+ ions is raised and an increase of internal Ca++ ions is observed, which stimulates the activity of the heart muscle. Heart glycosides have positive inotropic, negative chronotropic and dromoptropic and positive bathmotropic effects. Besides the pure glycosides, standardised extracts (digitaloids) are also used. Absorption and elimination of cardiac glycosides differ with their structure (e.g. lipophilicity). Early stages of heart insufficiency (NYHA I and II) can be treated with phytomedicines, such as Cratae- gus extracts, rich in antioxidant flavonoids and oligomeric proanthocyanidins that inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase, phosphodiesterase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Blood flow is enhanced by a positive inotro- pic and dromotropic effect. In addition, vascular resistance is reduced upon medication with standardised Crataegus extracts (e.g. WS 1442). Therapy should be accompanied by avoiding risks inherent in smoking, alcohol use and being overweight. Several placebo-controlled double-blind clinical studies provide evidence that extracts from Crataegus show efficacy for the treatment of patients with heart insufficiency NYHA I, II and even III (proprietary medicinal product: Crataegutt 600 mg). It has the same efficacy as the ACE inhibitor captopril.

Cardiac rhythm disturbance Disturbances of the pacemaker and conduction systems of the heart can result in irregular heartbeat (ar- rhythmia), in an enhanced heartbeat (tachycardia; >100 beats/min) or reduced heartbeat (bradycardia; <60 beats/min). Causes are complex and cardiac rhythm disturbances are symptoms of cardiac or other disorders, which can be influenced by psychosomatic factors. treatment Isolated alkaloids, such as quinidine, ajmaline and sparteine inhibit Na+-channels and ex- hibit anti-arrhythmic effects in that they influence the conduction system. Atropine reduces the influence of the vegetative nerve system, by blocking mAChR. Other phytochemicals influence the factors that have brought about cardiac rhythm disturbances, such as hypoxia, blood flow or metabolic imbalances; extracts of Crataegus fall into this category. In the case of rhythm disturbances caused by hyperthyroidism, bugleweed (Lycopus europaeus) may be given; in the case of heart rhythm disturbances with restlessness and tension states, valerian-hop preparations and generally extracts of Cytisus scoparius with quinolizidine alkaloids can be administered. main plants Atropa belladonna, Cinchona species, Crataegus monogyna and related species; Cytisus sco- parius, Humulus lupulus, Lycopus europaeus, Rauvolfia serpentina, Valeriana officinalis. Angina pectoris This is a coronary disorder caused by ischemia; it occurs in irregular attacks, accompanied by intense pains and a feeling of constriction and anxiety. treatment The condition is usually treated with nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium antagonists. A prophylactic treatment (not for acute attacks!) can be done with khellin and visnadin, isolated from Ammi visnaga. Both compounds are spasmolytic in coronary blood vessels and improve blood flow and oxygen supply in the heart. The alkaloids theophylline and papaverine inhibit cAMP-phosphodiesterase and have 383 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 383 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM therefore coronary dilating properties. Clinical studies provide evidence for the efficacy of Crataegus (see “heart insufficiency”) for this indication. In the case of arterial blood flow disturbances, ginkgo can be used or in the case of vegetatively triggered attacks Crataegus, Passiflora, Valeriana, Humulus and Melissa. main plants Ammi visnaga, Camellia sinensis, Crataegus monogyna and related species, Papaver somniferum. Plants used in traditional medicine: Alpinia officinarum, Capsicum annuum, C. frutescens, Humulus lupulus, Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata, Valeriana officinalis, Zingiber officinale. Functional heart problems Functional heart problems are often psychological. The symptoms perceived by patients are highly variable. The presence of angina pectoris and a myocardial infarction must be excluded before treatment. treatment In case of pressure in the chest, pulse anomalies and nervousness, the administration of Cra- taegus monogyna (proprietary medicinal product: Crataegutt novo) is recommended; and in case of cardiac chills, restlessness and thyroid hyperfunction Lycopus europaeus (proprietary medicinal product: Thyreogutt mono). In cases of general restlessness and tension valerian-hop preparations are recommended; and when feeling pressure and constriction in the upper abdomen, carminatives (e.g. proprietary medicinal product: Iberogast) are helpful. main plants Crataegus monogyna and Lycopus europaeus. Circulatory disorders (peripheral veno-occlusive arterial disease) If peripheral veins and arteries become obstructed or narrower because of arteriosclerotic deposits or inflam- mation of arterial walls, circulation of peripheral organs, such as legs, is reduced. As a consequence muscles and other tissues are no longer optimally supplied with oxygen, so that physical efforts become difficult and painful. Four stages are characterised (according to Fontaine): I, no complaints; II, Claudicatio intermittens (IIa: leg pains after more than 200 m of walking; IIb: leg pains after less than 200 m of walking); III, pains even when lying horizontally; IV, acral lesions and pains while resting. Cerebral circulatory disorder caused by arteriosclerotic or embolic processes lead to a reduced oxygen and glucose supply in the brain that results in metabolic and physiological imbalances of neurones. treatment Only patients with stages I and II can be treated with phytotherapy. The aim is to improve blood flow by dilatation of blood vessels and increase of cardiac output; control of prostacyclin and thromboxan formation in arteries and thrombocytes. In addition, risk factors such as enhanced levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, adipositas, lack of physical exercise and smoking, should be observed and eliminated. Cerebral circulation problems can be improved by increasing oxygen and glucose supply; vasodilatation, e.g. by ajmalicine, vincamine, reduced ergot alkaloids (dihydroergocristin), theophylline and papaverine can enhance blood flow through cerebral capillaries. The prevention of oedemas, e.g. by aescin or flavonoids (rutin) is also of interest. Controlled double-blind clinical studies provide evidence (improvement by over 30% as compared to placebo) that Ginkgo extracts (EGb 761; Tebonin) improve symptoms of peripheral and cerebral circulatory disorders. For treatment of oedemas, aescin from horse chestnut and flavonoids (e.g. rutin) are also important. For local tissue damage (ulceration, gangrene), external treatment with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial extracts of chamomile (e.g. Camillin), witch hazel (e.g. Hametum cream) and St John’s wort (e.g. Red Oil; Jukunda) is useful. Circulation disorders are traditionally also treated with stimulant and skin-irritating essential oils, which are applied externally and sometimes internally. main plants Camellia sinensis, Fagopyrum esculentum, Ginkgo biloba, Hamamelis virginiana, Matricaria chamomilla, Papaver somniferum, Rauvolfia serpentina, Vinca minor; ergot alkaloids from Claviceps purpurea. essential oils Cinnamomum camphora and isolated camphor, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha ×piperita, Picea abies, Rosmarinus officinalis. 384 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 384 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM Hypertension and hypotension Hypertension is characterised by a blood pressure above 140/90 mm Hg; causes are often difficult to define. Hypotension is defined by a blood pressure below 105/60 mm Hg and can be caused by physiological or hormonal imbalances and blood loss. treatment Treatment of hypertension includes accompanying measures, such as reducing salt (NaCl) and alcohol intake, nicotine abstinence and increasing physical activity. Medicinal treatment involves the application of diuretic, sympathetic, vasodilative drugs, of ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and aldosterone antagonists. Phytomedicine can provide diuretic, sympathetic, vasodilative drugs that can be useful in mild forms of hypertension. The alkaloids reserpine, rescinnamine and serpentine (which inhibit the re-uptake of noradrenaline into presynaptic vesicles) have been used to treat severe forms of hypertension. Hypotension can be improved by physical exercise and plant extracts with stimulating properties, such as purine alkaloids (caffeine) or vasoconstricting activities (e.g. ergot alkaloids, ephedrine). main anD traDitional plants Hypertension: Adonis vernalis, Allium sativum, Convallaria majalis, Crataegus monogyna and related species, Digitalis purpurea, D. lanata, Drimia maritima, Helleborus niger, Nerium oleander, Rauvolfia serpentina. Hypotension: Camellia sinensis, Claviceps purpurea (e.g. ergotamine, 9,10-dihy- droergotamine), Coffea arabica, Cola nitida, Cytisus scoparius, Ephedra distachya, Rosmarinus officinalis; isolated alkaloids from Claviceps purpurea (e.g. ergotamine and 9,10-dihydroergotamine). Other plants: Betula species, Equisetum arvense, Humulus lupulus, Olea europaea, Solidago virgaurea, Valeriana officinalis, Viscum album. Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI); varicosis Venous circulatory disorder, especially in lower extremities (legs) can lead to varicosis, thrombophlebitis and phlebothrombosis and in consequence to chronic venous insufficiency. Endothelia of veins become leaky and by loss of fibrous tissues the valves of veins lose their function. This disorder is thus mainly caused by a reduced venous drainage (obstruction of deep veins or insufficiency of the valves of veins). Symptoms are complex and include a feeling of heaviness in legs, oedema, nightly cramps in the leg, pain and itching. In severe cases, a venous ulcer or ulcer cruris varicosum (open sore on the leg) may occur. treatment Besides physical treatment (compression bandages to improve haemodynamics), exercise, and surgery, CVI can be treated medicinally using diuretics (short-term), oedema protectant as well as anti-inflammatory drugs (long-term therapy). The latter therapy is aimed at reducing the permeability of capillaries and thereby preventing oedema formation. In addition, CVI is treated by compression bandages or compression stockings to improve haemodynamics, as well as by vein ablation and lymphatic drainage. A randomised placebo-controlled clinical study has shown that aescin (100 mg per day of a triterpene fraction from horse chestnut seeds; Aesculus hippocastanum; proprietary medicinal product: Venoplant retard S) improves the symptoms of CVI, especially when accompanied by physical treatment. The antioxidative and anti-inflammatory flavonoid (from Fagopyrum and Styphnolobium) rutin and partial synthetic derivatives (e.g. troxerutin) also reduce oedema formation. In addition to aescin, extracts of Ruscus aculeatus, sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis) and red grape vine (Vitis vinifera) can be administered. External applications of aescin (Venostasin cream) and Arnica montana (e.g. Kneipp Arnika Ointment S) can also be used. In the case of venous ulcers, systemic and local phytotherapy is possible: internally with horse chestnut extracts (e.g. Aescorin forte) and echinacea (e.g. Echinacin Liquidum), and externally with anti-inflammatory extracts of chamomile (e.g. Kamillosan concentrate solution, Hametum cream), marigold flowers (e.g. Calendumed cream), oak bark and other tannins. main anD traDitional plants Aesculus hippocastanum, Calendula officinalis, Centella asiatica, Echinacea purpurea, Fagopyrum esculentum, Hamamelis virginiana, Matricaria chamomilla, Melilotus altissima, Melilotus officinalis, Quercus robur, Ruscus aculeatus, Styphnolobium japonicum, Vitis vinifera. 385 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 385 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM Cerebral and neurological disorders Dementia and brain dysfunction Dementia is a loss of individually acquired intellectual capabilities (i.e. memory, concentration, learning, vigilance, power of judgement, spatial orientation, articulation). It also manifests as an inability to cope with ordinary daily problems or to interact properly in a professional and social context (e.g. affective disorders, such as loss of motivation, emotional control or social behaviour). Severe forms of vascular (also called multi- infarct or arteriosclerotic) dementia (frequency: 10–20%) and/or degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type (50% of all demential illnesses) lead to complete loss of personality and imbecility. In 25% of dementia cases, patients suffer from both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Degenerative and multi-infarct dementia increases with age: Whereas ca. 5% of the population of 65 years of age suffer from dementia, the frequency is up to 30% in persons over 80–90 years of age. The pathology of dementia is complex and includes increased vasoconstriction of brain capillaries, deficiency of certain neurotransmitters, increased platelet aggregation and ischemia (multi-infarct), free radicals, membrane defects, disorder of cerebral metabolism or progressive degeneration of neurones. treatment Most treatments are symptomatic and can temporarily improve quality of life or delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease by up to 1–2 years. Improvement of central cholinergic systems can be achieved through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (e.g. by galanthamine, physostigmine, huperzine A, Ginkgo extracts or synthetic drugs, such as donepezil, memantine, rivastigmine and tacrine). Furthermore, Ginkgo extracts may protect membranes and neurones from death and apoptosis, improve cerebral metabolism, protect against hypoxia and ischemia, cure cerebral oedemas, improve radical scavenging and haemodynamic and haemorheological properties of the blood (e.g. PAF antagonism). A large number of controlled clinical studies (placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised trials) have proven the efficacy of Ginkgo extracts (especially Ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761, Tebonin) in dementia. Ginkgo cannot cure dementia, but it can slow down the progression of the disease. Tebonin improves concentration, memory performance, resilience and emotional stability. Medicinal therapy should be accompanied by orientation, reminiscence and validation therapy. Crataegus preparations are also suitable treatment for dementia and cerebral dysfunction, as they improve cardiac circulatory function and thus the blood circulation of the brain. main plants Crataegus monogyna, Ginkgo biloba, Galanthus nivalis, Huperzia selago, Physostigma venenosum. Dizziness (vertigo) Dizziness is the result of a disturbance of equilibrium due to the vestibular and optical senses no longer being congruent. Vertigo can be accompanied by anxiety, emesis, nausea, profuse perspiration, tachycardia, labyrin- thine ataxia, collapse and nystagmus. The causes of this disorder can be manifold, ranging from disturbances in the vestibule, disorder in the central nervous system, to side-effects from medicines (e.g. streptomycin) or alcohol to ophthalmologic, psychiatric or orthopaedic problems. treatment Vertigo therapy involves a treatment of any basic disorder, physical training, and symptom- atically by medicines. A few controlled clinical studies over 60 to 160 days have shown that symptoms of dizziness improve after treatment with Ginkgo extracts (240 mg Ginkgo special extract EGb 761). main plants Ginkgo biloba. Ringing in ear (tinnitus) This ailment manifests as variable noise in the ears (in absence of external sources), such as whistling, buzzing, ringing or hissing sounds, often accompanied by defective or impaired hearing. Tinnitus can occur sporadically, continuously or synchronously with heartbeat or breathing. It can be caused by infection or nearly any disorder of the ear, by certain medicines (e.g. quinidine; salicylates, aminoglycoside antibiotics), by disorders of heart and circulation (e.g. hypertony; arteriosclerosis), neurodegeneration, brain tumours, or by Morbus Ménière. Tinnitus can lead to insomnia, lack of concentration, anxiety, frustration, depression, headache and psychological disturbances. 386 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 386 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM treatment Treatment of the basic disorder that has secondarily caused tinnitus is the method of choice. Five placebo-controlled double-blind clinical studies, three reference-controlled studies with 535 patients and 11 open clinical studies with 1 802 patients showed the efficacy of Ginkgo (120–240 mg per day of EGb 761) to reduce the intensity of tinnitus noise. main plants Ginkgo biloba. Travel sickness Dizziness followed by vomiting (emesis) is caused by hyperexcitation in the motoric centre of the CNS (vestibular disturbances). treatment Important plant substances include the tropane alkaloid scopolamine, which blocks musca- rinic AChR and therefore sedates motoric and vegetative centres of the brain stem. In addition, Zingiber officinale and fishberry (Anamirta cocculus) appear to help to overcome travel sickness, vertigo and nausea (also nausea caused by therapeutics). main plants Datura stramonium and other plants with scopolamine, Zingiber officinale. Plants used in traditional medicine: Anamirta cocculus. Psychological and psychosomatic disturbances Depression, mood disturbances, anxiety and sleep disorders are among the mental illnesses which can be treated with phytotherapy. Acute severe depression and schizophrenia should not be treated with phy- totherapeutics. Psychic diseases and disorders can be caused by disturbance of the equilibrium between neurotransmitters, receptors and transporters of neurotransmitters. A low concentration of noradrenaline and serotonin is often connected with depression whereas an increased concentration of neurotransmitters (especially dopamine) can lead to schizophrenic-type disorders. Depression The main symptoms are low spirit, cheerless mood, loss of interest and motivation and fatigue. Side-effects are complex and include insomnia, feelings of guilt, low self-confidence and even suicidal thoughts. Women are twice as likely to be affected than men. treatment The aim of antidepressive drugs is to raise the level of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin. This can be achieved either by application of a neurotransmitter agonist that stimulates the corresponding recep- tor, by MAO inhibitors, or most commonly by so-called re-uptake inhibitors which block amine transporters at the presynapse. As a result, noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine stay in the synaptic cleft, are not degraded by MAO or COMT and their local concentration is raised. Phytomedicine has been successfully used to treat mild depressions: extracts from Hypericum perforatum block the presynaptic transporters and raise the concentration not only of noradrenaline but also of serotonin, dopamine, GABA and other neurotransmitters. Several controlled double-blind studies have proven the efficacy of H. perforatum (compared to placebo and synthetic antidepressants, e.g. parotexin) to improve the mood of patients with mild (not severe) depression. The doses were 900 mg WS 5570 per day. In addition to taking psychopharmaceuticals, patients should get sufficient exercise and exposure to sunlight. The effect of antidepressants does not manifest immediately, but only after 2–3 weeks of ingestion. Depression during menopause can be treated with Actaea racemosa; in the early stages of dementia Ginkgo biloba special extracts can be useful. Conditions related to the aging process, with concomitant exhaustion and fatigue, can be treated with Panax ginseng and Eleutherococcus senticosus. main plants Hypericum perforatum. Anxiety Patients with anxiety and fear have the subjective feeling of dangerous threat (even mortal terror), and suffer from psychological and vegetative symptoms, such as nervousness, concentration problems, dizziness, headaches, paleness, tightness in the throat, perspiration, trembles, rapid heartbeat, raised blood pressure, loss of appetite and diarrhoea. Anxiety, accompanied by tension and restlessness can continue for weeks. 387 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 387 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM treatment Anxiety is treated with anxiolytics or tranquillisers. The aim is to separate the influence of psychic conditions on the vegetative system. Activation of the GABA receptor with benzodiazepins (at the “benzodiazepin”-receptor), leads to attenuation of the limbic system, to muscle relaxation, sedation and spasmolytic effects. Controlled clinical studies have shown the efficacy of kava kava when compared with synthetic benzodiazepins. However, due to drug negligence, kava kava was discontinued as a drug in some countries, including Germany in 2002. However, homoeopathic preparations and dietary supplements may still be commercially available. Re-registration is currently under discussion. Since anxiety can also be part of depression, treatment with Hypericum perforatum would be possible. Instead of kava kava, valerian preparations are used in combination with Humulus lupulus and Melissa officinalis. main plants Humulus lupulus, Hypericum perforatum, Melissa officinalis, Piper methysticum. Insomnia, tension and restlessness Patients with insomnia suffer from a bad sleep quality, and difficulties falling asleep and sleeping without interruptions. Patients worry much about their insomnia, fear negative consequences and go through mood swings. They show an increased irritability, general tiredness, often also tension and restlessness. treatment Insomnia, tension and restlessness can be treated with GABA receptor agonists and other sedatives. A number of plant extracts affect the GABA receptor (including Valeriana officinalis, Humulus lupulus, Passiflora incarnata). Plants with essential oils (such as Lavandula angustifolia, Melissa officinalis) can be regarded as mild spasmolytic drugs that also alleviate nervousness and tension. A number of controlled clinical studies have shown the efficacy of Valeriana officinalis to treat insomnia, often in combination with Melissa officinalis, Lavandula angustifolia, Passiflora incarnata or hops. Valerian is the most important herbal sedative; it is not only calming but also a muscle relaxant and spasmolytic. The effect is seldom immediate, but rather occurs after a period of regular intake. In addition, patients with sleep disorders should avoid con- stant noise and stress, take sufficient exercise and learn to relax. In patients with hyperthyroidism (symptoms of tachycardia, sweating, nervousness), Lycopus europaeus is traditionally used, and for circulatory problems with restlessness and stress, Crataegus and camphor essential oils, or the associated drug can be used in bath preparations or teas for insomnia or nervous restlessness. A traditional tea recipe for sedation includes Valeriana officinalis, Citrus aurantium, Humulus lupulus, Melissa officinalis and Mentha ×piperita. main plants Symptoms of insomnia, tension and restlessness have been successfully treated with Hu- mulus lupulus, Lavandula angustifolia, Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata, Valeriana officinalis.

Exhaustion, weakness, stress This symptom complex comprises vitality problems, a decrease of psychological and physical vigilance, an increased susceptibility for infections, insomnia and burnout symptoms. It is especially common in elderly people. treatment Tonics can be regarded as adaptogens that work against exhaustion, weakness and stress. The pharmacology of the mostly complex extracts is not well understood. It has been speculated that adaptogens might have corticomimetic, immune-stimulating and neuromodulatory effects, and that they stimulate cellular metabolism. Several clinical trials with real ginseng and Siberian ginseng have shown efficacy. Stimulants containing caffeine also help with exhaustion and fatigue, as they stimulate the sympathetic and shorten the parasympathetic recovery phase. They increase alertness in the short term, but are not suitable in the long term for the treatment of exhaustion. Caffeine is a central stimulant, positively inotropic, in low doses negatively chronotropic, while higher doses have a positive chronotropic, diuretic and peripheral blood ves- sel dilatation action. However, central vessels are rather contracted. Very high doses of caffeine cause sleep disturbances and nervous restlessness. In burnout syndrome, Panax ginseng, Ginkgo biloba and sometimes Hypericum perforatum are used. Drugs containing bitter and pungent ingredients are used in traditional medicine for fatigue and weakness accompanied by dyspeptic symptoms and loss of appetite. Aphrodisiacs, which have been used in all cultures, are also included here. 388 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 388 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM main plants Tonics and adaptogens: Eleutherococcus senticosus, Lessertia frutescens, Panax ginseng, Withania somnifera.

Disorders of the digestive tract Irritation of the stomach and intestinal tract (including dyspepsia, lack of appe- tite, spasms, nausea, vomiting) Disorders of the digestive tract include functional and chronic disturbances, and psychosomatic complaints, such as irritable stomach and colon, and various forms of dyspepsia. Psychosomatic dysfunctions do not result in pathological or morphological changes but are characterised by a disturbance of gut motility and tonicity, or an imbalance of secretion of gastric juice and digestive enzymes and the absorption of nutrients. Symptoms include heartburn, lack of appetite, belching, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, pressure and a feeling of fullness, flatulence and regurgitation. treatment Besides dietetic measures and the exclusion of certain foods, phytomedicines can be useful. These include plants that modulate the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile, that buffer gastric acid, enhance gut motility, but reduce spasms and are anti-inflammatory. Drugs with antimicrobial essential oils or pungent principles (aromatica, acria) the former usually termed “carminatives”. They enhance the secretion of gastric and digestive fluids in patients with lack of appetite and dyspepsia; they are slightly spasmolytic, reduce discomfort from bloating, and show anti- inflammatory, antibacterial and antifungal effects. Drugs with bitter compounds (amara, amara-aromatica), such as iridoids and sesquiterpenes, alkaloids, triterpenes and flavonoids; they enhance the production of saliva, gastric juice and bile. They are taken 20–30 minutes before a meal (but not in cases of stomach and intestinal ulcers). Drugs with mucilage (mucilaginosa) protect mucous membranes. Hydrolytic enzymes (such as papain, bromelain, ficin) can be used to substitute a lack of endogenous enzyme (proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin) production. Drugs with atropine and other tropane alkaloids are antispasmodic since they inhibit muscarinic AChR of smooth intestinal muscles and inhibit muscle contraction. Controlled clinical trials with peppermint and caraway oil have shown evidence that carminatives are effec- tive in the treatment of irritable colon, similar to the synthetic drug Cisapride. In case of loss of appetite as a result of a general exhaustion, the combination drug Amara-Pascoe (from red cinchona, yellow gentian, bitter orange) can be administered; the clinically tested Iberogast (combination of nine medicinal plants) can be taken if gastric secretion with regurgitation and gastrointestinal cramping occurs. In the case of dyspeptic complaints, chamomile (e.g. chamomile concentrates), Iberogast, cumin and peppermint oil (e.g. Enteroplant), artichoke leaves (Hepar SL forte), haronga bark (e.g. Harongan drops) and the combination remedy Carminativum-Hetterich have proven to be effective. Nausea with dizziness and headache may be treated with ginger (Zingiber officinale), chamomile (e.g. Kamillosan concentrate solution) or the combina- tion remedy Iberogast; pregnancy-related nausea can be treated with mint oil. Traditional teas for appetite loss include angelica root, yarrow, common centaury and wormwood; for dyspeptic symptoms anise, fennel, cumin and chamomile. main anD traDitional plants Carminatives with essential oils: Achillea millefolium, Angelica archangel- ica, Artemisia vulgaris, Carum carvi, Coriandrum sativum, Crocus sativus, Elettaria cardamomum, Foeniculum vulgare, Matricaria chamomilla, Melissa officinalis, Mentha ×piperita, Pimpinella anisum, Rosmarinus officinalis.

Gastritis and ulcers Acute gastritis can be caused by alcohol, drugs or cold drinks and affect the mucous membranes of the stomach. Chronic gastritis is characterised by a reduced hydrochloric acid (HCl) production or a reflux of gut content into the stomach. In the latter case, ulcers can develop. Ulcers of the stomach and duode- num are the result of a microbial infection by a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, which finds optimal growth conditions when the mucosal membranes are disturbed. The condition can be accompanied by stomach cramps. treatment Basically, H. pylori is treated with antibiotics, but gastritis and ulcers also benefit from phytomedicines. Gastric acid secretion can be inhibited by tropane alkaloids, such as atropine. Mucous membranes are protected with mucilaginosa and anti-inflammatory drugs. Cramps and colic can be treated with phytomedicines containing tropane alkaloids or essential oils that show membrane activity. Tradition- ally, the anti-inflammatory liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) is used, but its use should be limited in the long term (disruption of potassium levels). In the case of gastritis and ulcers, the combination remedy Iberogast, chamomile (e.g. Kamillin concentrate), Sedarcur Forte (from valerian, hops, lemon balm) or Sedonium (valerian) may be administered. Any phytotherapeutic treatment should be supported by dietetic measures (avoiding acidic, very sweet or spicy foods and drinks, alcohol, coffee and ulcerogenic medicines) and a reduction of stress. main plants Achillea millefolium, Althaea officinalis, Alpinia officinarum, Angelica archangelica, Atropa bel- ladonna, Calendula officinalis, Carum carvi, Coriandrum sativum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Humulus lupulus, Malva sylvestris, Matricaria chamomilla, Melissa officinalis, Mentha ×piperita, Mentzelia cordifolia.

Diarrhoea, colitis and diverticulitis Acute diarrhoea can derive from psychosomatic disturbances, or be caused by infections (viral, bacte- rial, fungal and parasitic) or intoxication (alcohol, heavy metals, laxatives, antibiotics, and several other xenobiotics, food intolerances). Chronic diarrhoea can result from an acute diarrhoea (and its causes), but also from organic disorders of the gut, from pancreatic insufficiency, food allergies and hormonal disturbances. Colitis ulcerosa and Morbus Crohn are chronic inflammations of the gut. Morbus Crohn affects lower small intestine and colon and is characterised by diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fistula or fever. Colitis affects the mucosa of the large intestine and rectum and is accompanied by ulcers. It can be caused by psychosomatic and autoimmune disturbances. Diverticulitis can be a cause of senile atrophy of the rectum and is accom- panied by the formation of gut invaginations (diverticula) that are chronically inflamed. treatment Patients with Morbus Crohn and Colitis ulcerosa should avoid sugar and cereals (e.g. bread) and keep a strict dietary regime. In addition, plants with calming, spasmolytic, anti-inflammatory, anti- allergic, swelling and carminative properties can be useful. The use of the medicinal plants and proprietary medicinal products Mutaflor (contains E. coli Nissle), Myrrhinil Intest 4-4-4 (with chamomile, myrrh and coffee carbon), Indian frankincense (Boswellia serrata, e.g. Sallaki) and psyllium (e.g. Agiocur granules). Since psychological factors often play a role, St John’s wort, valerian and hops can also be given. In acute diarrhoea, short-term food intake and electrolyte substitution are important. Loss of fluids and minerals can be counteracted by administering electrolytes and glucose. Acute diarrhoea is treated by calming down gut motility (e.g. opium or Uzara), by astringent tannins (that bind receptors and microorganisms), by anti- inflammatory drugs (with mucilage, and essential oils), by adsorption of toxins (e.g. activated charcoal, 390 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 390 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM medicinal coal, clay, kaolin), by filling the gut with swelling substances (e.g. flax, psyllium), by enzyme substitution, by adding special yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces boulardii, e.g. Perenterol) or Escherichia coli (e.g. Mutaflor). In practice, eating dried blueberries, carrot soup and grated apple (with skin!) have proven to be effective remedies. main plants Astringent plants: Camellia sinensis, Hamamelis virginiana, Krameria lappacea, Lythrum salicaria, Potentilla erecta, Rubus fruticosus, Quercus robur, Vaccinium myrtillus.

Plants used in traditional medicine: Agrimonia eupatoria, Castanea sativa, Fragaria vesca, Galeopsis segetum, Geum urbanum, Potentilla anserina, Rubus idaeus. Constipation Constipation can be caused by food low in fibres, lack of motility, psychosomatic disturbances, extreme adipositas, medicines (e.g. opium, morphine, anticholinergics, antipyretics, sympathomimetics, antidepres- sants, laxatives) and organic disorders (haemorrhoids, colon irritability, inflammation and gut tumours). treatment The aim is to activate gut motility by bodily exercise and food rich in fibres. If necessary, plant material with swelling or osmotic properties can be used. Stimulant laxatives (with anthranoids) are favoured by patients but should be used with care, since they can lead to chronic constipation. The reduced and deglucosylated anthrone (glycosides are hydrolysed in the gut) and anthranol are the active form of anthranoids. They stimulate the release of histamine and prostaglandins, thus increasing gut motility. The absorption of sodium and chloride ions is reduced thus increasing osmotically the water content in the faeces. In the large intestine, an increased secretion of mucilage takes place. In combination, all these activities lead to a strong laxative effect. Osmotically active sugars such as lactose, lactulose, mannitol and sorbitol are not absorbed but remain in the gut and draw water osmotically. Typical swelling and bulking agents that increase stool volume and stimulate intestinal motility are agar agar (from red algae), psyllium, wheat bran and flax (linseed). main plants Laxatives: Aloe vera (=A. barbadensis), Aloe ferox, Rhamnus catharticus, Rhamnus frangula, Rhamnus purshianus, Rheum officinale, Rheum palmatum, Ricinus communis, Senna alexandrina. Fibres and swelling drugs: Agar from Gelidium, Ahnfeltia species, Astracantha gummifera, Ficus carica, Linum usitatissimum, Plantago afra, Plantago arenaria, Plantago ovata, Tamarindus indica, Triticum aestivum. Osmotics: mannitol, sorbitol from various fruits.

Haemorrhoids and proctitis Proctitis is an inflammation of the rectum, often found in patients with Morbus Crohn and colitis. They suffer from spasms of the anal sphincter, constipation and pruritus. Haemorrhoids (inner and outer) are dilations of anal arteries that may be inflamed and bleeding. treatment Proctitis and haemorrhoids are treated locally with anti-inflammatory, astringent, haemostyptic, analgesic, antimicrobial and spasmolytic phytomedicines. In cases of haemorrhoidal discomfort, milk-thistle fruits (e.g. Legalon 70 Protect), horse chestnut seeds (e.g. Aescorin Forte), camomile flowers (e.g. Kamillin external), oak bark and witch hazel leaves (e.g. Hametum haemorrhoid suppository) are used. main anD traDitional plants Aesculus hippocastanum, Arnica montana, Atropa belladonna, Fagopyrum esculentum, Hamamelis virginiana, Hypericum perforatum, Matricaria chamomilla, Myroxylon balsamum, Potentilla erecta, Quercus robur, Ruscus aculeatus, Silybum marianum, Symphytum officinale. 391 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 391 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM Disorders of the liver and bile system Infections of the liver and intoxications The liver is the main organ of metabolism (e.g. lipid metabolism, protein biosynthesis; glycogen storage) and detoxification in the body. Viral, bacterial and parasitic infections or toxins (toxins from mushrooms, lower fungi, plants or chemical industry) that destroy liver cells, can be life-threatening. Liver cirrhosis as a result of long-term alcohol abuse can be considered in this context. Some compounds damage the endothelia of blood vessels in the liver, such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids, arsenic and other toxins. On the other hand, the liver has a high regeneration capability, so that new cells can easily replace the destroyed tissue (once the causative agent has disappeared). treatment Only a few medicinal plants exist that can alleviate severe liver damage. Basically, secondary metabolites, such as lignans (“silymarin”) in Silybum marianum (proprietary medicinal product, e.g. Legalon, Silimarite), help to stabilise and seal membranes of liver cells, so that toxins cannot enter. Silymarin is a radical scavenger, stimulates RNA transcription and protein biosynthesis and supports the regeneration of damaged liver tissue. Controlled clinical studies have shown that the lignan fraction of S. marianum is useful to treat mushroom poisoning (e.g. by Amanita phalloides) and damaged liver (after viral infections, e.g. hepatitis C; alcohol abuse or chemical intoxications) in doses of 200–400 mg silymarin per day. A placebo-controlled double-blind study with 170 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis provided clear evidence that survival was significantly enhanced in the silymarin treated group. Soy lecithin is also used to treat toxic-nutritive liver damage. main plants Cynara cardunculus, phospholipids from Glycine max, Silybum marianum. Plants used in traditional medicine: Agrimonia eupatoria, Beta vulgaris, Eclipta alba, Helichrysum arenarium, Phyllanthus amarus, Picrorhiza kurrooa, Rehmannia glutinosa, Schisandra chinensis. Disorders of gall production, gall bladder and bile ducts Bile is produced in the liver and transported to the intestine via the bile ducts. Bile acids have emulgat- ing properties that help the digestion of lipid material by lipase in the gut. A decreased bile production is therefore bad for intestinal digestion. Bacterial infection of the bile duct and gall bladder and gallstones (resulting from cholesterol, calcium carbonate, bilirubin; cholelithiasis) cause inflammation. Disorders include disturbance of motility of bile ducts, painful biliary colics, cramps of the sphincter oddii, and abdominal pains in the epigastrium. treatment Obstruction of the bile ducts and severe infections are not treated by phytotherapy, but phytotherapy is recommended for dyskinesia and inflammation of the bile ducts. Cholagogues that enhance bile production and flow are divided into choleretics, which stimulate bile production in the liver, and cholekinetics, which promote contraction of the gall bladder and of the bile duct and thus bile flow. Several secondary metabolites are transported via the bile duct into the duodenum and can therefore reach target tissues in the bile duct. Drugs with tropane and other alkaloids (Atropa belladonna, Scopolia carniolica, Peumus boldo, Fumaria officinalis, Chelidonium majus) inhibit muscarinergic acetylcholine receptors and are therefore spasmolytic. Plant drugs with essential oils or lipophilic terpenoids (such as Artemisia absinthium, Mentha species, Angelica archangelica, Curcuma longa, C. xanthorrhiza, Elettaria cardamomum and others) also exhibit a weak spasmolytic effect. Spasmolytic drugs release spasms and reduce pain. Some of the cholagogues have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, such as Chelidonium majus or Harpagophytum procumbens. Plants with essential oil and mustard oil may be used as supportive treat- ment of bacterial infections and inflammation of the biliary tract (Achillea millefolium, Angelica archangelica, Curcuma longa, C. xanthorrhiza, Elettaria cardamomum, Raphanus sativus). Several drugs taste bitter and are considered to have choleretic effects (such as Cynara cardunculus, Helichrysum arenarium, Marrubium vulgare, Peumus boldus, Taraxacum officinale). Controlled clinical studies are not available and the pharmacological properties of the drugs mentioned are sometimes disputed by pharmacologists. Proprietary medicinal products that have proven worthwhile for cramping, abdominal pain and nausea include Spasmo Gallo Sanol N (from Mentha ×piperita) and Enteroplant (cumin and peppermint oil); and for 392 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 392 6/5/2017 11:08:39 AM bloating and abdominal complaints: Curcu-Truw (from turmeric), Hepar SL forte (from Cynara cardunculus), Pascoventral (from chamomile, caraway, peppermint) and Harongan (from Harungana madagascariensis).

Disorders of the lipid metabolism Hyperlipidemia and arteriosclerosis Arteriosclerosis can result from hyper- and dyslipidemia, nicotine abuse, arterial hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, overweight, hereditary disposition and lack of physical exercise. Hyperlipidemia is characterised by enhanced blood levels of triglycerides (>150 mg per 100 ml) and cholesterol (>200–240 mg per 100 ml). Raised levels of blood lipids can be a risk factor for the develop- ment of arteriosclerosis. The lipid metabolism (which includes lipoproteins, such as HDL, LDL, VLDL and their receptors) and the corresponding arteriosclerotic changes of arterial walls are interrelated in a complex network and often linked with hypertension and other coronary disorders. Arteriosclerosis is a risk factor for cardiac infarction and stroke. treatment These conditions are mainly treated with synthetic preparations (e.g. fibrates and statins) that are not free from side-effects, but phytotherapy (allicin, sesquiterpene lactones, sitosterols, phospholipids, unsaturat- ed fatty acids) and a fibre-rich diet can have a positive effect and can lower blood lipids to some degree (up to 20%). Garlic and onions, which are used for lipid metabolism disorders with a tendency to arteriosclerosis, are rich in the sulfur-containing alliin. Upon tissue damage, alliin is cleaved by alliinase to allicin. Allicin is highly reactive and can bind to any sulfhydryl group of enzymes, receptors or other proteins. It is therefore not surprising that quite a number of molecular targets appear to be affected in the human body and that pharmacological responses (lipid reduction, reduced blood pressure, increased coagulation time, reduction of the blood glu- cose level, antimicrobial effects) are manifold. A number of clinical trials have been performed with garlic, indicating that cholesterol and triglyceride levels can be reduced by 10 to 20%. However, the validity of these studies has been questioned. Clinical studies with artichoke (e.g. Hepar SL forte) have demonstrated efficacy for lipid reduction. A standardised oil extract from Perilla frutescens (TUIM arteria 1-1-1 Kps.) con- tains unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids and has a positive effect on lipid metabolism disorders. main plants Allium sativum, A. cepa, Cynara cardunculus. Plants used in traditional medicine: Allium ursinum, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Perilla frutescens. Disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract Infection and inflammation of the urinary tract (including bladder and kidney stones, urolithiasis, nephrolithiasis) Bacterial infections may occur internally, either from blood or lymphatic tissues, or from outside, via the urethra. These infections are favoured by urinary obstructions and can lead to inflammation. treatment Arbutin, present in Arctostaphylos uva-ursi and other Ericaceae (proprietary medicinal prod- uct, e.g. Cystinol Acute), mustard oils (from horseradish, Armoracia rusticana, and nasturtium, Tropaeolum majus, proprietary medicinal product, e.g. Angocin Anti-Infekt N) and sesquiterpenes in Santalum album are eliminated via the urinary tract and show antibacterial activity. The Ericaceae extracts are said to reduce 393 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 393 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM the attachment of E. coli to the mucous membranes of the bladder and urinary tract. Antibacterial drugs are often combined with a purging therapy to alleviate the symptoms, especially since the increased urine production after drug administration (aquaretics) also has a rinsing effect. In severe cases, treatment with antibiotics becomes necessary. Inflammation of the kidneys and urinary tract can be caused by bacterial infections, urinary gravel and stones (formed from urate, oxalate, cystine, xanthine or creatine). Inflammations can be accompanied by spasms. Diuretic drugs containing terpenoids, coumarins, furanocoumarins, flavonoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, or their metabolic products, lead to increased urine formation and have a rinsing and anti-inflammatory effect in the urinary tract. More diluted urine prevents stone formation (prophylactic ef- fect). Proven tea mixtures (“bladder and kidney tea”) contain bearberry and birch leaves, garden bean and horsetail extracts. When spastic pains occur, they can be treated with spasmolytic drugs, such as Scopolia carniolica or Petasites hybridus. In the case of stones and gravel, diuretic, spasmolytic and litholytic drugs can be applied. The commercial preparations Aqualibra (from goldenrod, spiny restharrow, orthosiphon) and Canephron N (from lovage, rosemary, common centaury) have proven their efficacy. In the case of dysuria (painful urination) and irritable bladder, which can also have psychosomatic and hor- monal causes, the following proprietary medicinal products can be used: Carito mono (from orthosiphon), Canephron N, Nomon mono (from pumpkin seeds), Klimadynon uno (from Actaea racemosa), Pascosedon (from valerian, hops, lemon balm) and Esbericum (from St John’s wort). main anD traDitional plants Diuretic and/or antimicrobial drugs: Agathosma betulina, Angelica archangelica, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Armoracia rusticana, Apium graveolens, Asparagus officinalis, Betula pendula and related species, Equisetum arvense, Fagopyrum esculentum, Genista tinctoria, Helichrysum arenarium, Hel- leborus niger, Herniaria glabra, Hibiscus sabdariffa, Juniperus communis, Levisticum officinale, Melilotus officinalis, Ononis spinosa, Orthosiphon aristatus, Petroselinum crispum, Phaseolus vulgaris, Pimpinella major, Polygonum hydrop- iper, Pterocarpus santalinus, Ribes nigrum, Rosa canina, Santalum album, Smilax species, Solidago canadensis, S. vir- gaurea, Taraxacum officinale, Tropaeolum majus, Urtica dioica, Vaccinium oxycoccos, V. macrocarpon, Viola tricolor.

Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) This condition is characterised by an increased size of the prostate caused by growth of fibromuscular and epithelial tissues around urethra. The frequency of BPH increases with age and about 70% of men above 75 have BPH, but only 30–40% of men suffer from it. Symptoms include dysuria, increased urination, urgency to urinate, especially at night (nycturia), and difficulty to urinate. Consequences of urethra constriction through BPH are decreased urine flow and pressure and urine retention in the bladder. It is likely that BPH is caused by a decrease in testosterone production and in its increased conversion to estradiol (by aromatase), dihydrotestosterone (known to induce growth of prostatic epithelia) and androstandiol (by the enzymes 5- and 3-reductase, respectively). treatment Besides surgery and other invasive treatments, BHP can be treated with chemically de- fined medicines (e.g. finasteride and alpha receptor blockers) and phytotherapy (especially plants with phytosterols). The aim is to inhibit the proliferation of periurethral tissues and to relax urethral and prostatic muscles in order to enhance urethral flow. More than 20 controlled clinical studies (double- blind, randomised) proved the efficacy of Serenoa and Urtica, alone (e.g. Bazaton uno) or in combination (e.g. Prostagutt Forte, containing 320 mg of Serenoa and 240 mg of Urtica extract per day), to reduce BPH symptoms. The benefits were comparable to those of finasteride or tamulosin, but with fewer side-effects. In addition, the following proprietary medicinal products have shown promise for pain and inflammation: Phytodolor tincture (from ash tree bark, goldenrod, American aspen), Angocin Anti-Infekt N (from nas- turtium and horseradish) and Canephron N (from lovage, rosemary, centaury). 394 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 394 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM main anD traDitional plants Armoracia rusticana, Centaurium erythraea, Cucurbita pepo; Epilobium parviflorum, E. angustifolium, Hypoxis hemerocallidea (=H. rooperi); pollen from Secale cereale, Phleum pratense, Zea mays (extractum pollinis siccum), Populus tremuloides, P. tremula, Prunus africana, Rosmarinus officinalis, Sco- polia carniolica, Serenoa repens (=Sabal serrulata), Solidago virgaurea, Tropaeolum majus, Urtica dioica.

Disorders of the musculoskeletal system Rheumatism and arthritis Rheumatic disorders that can be treated with phytomedicines include soft tissue rheumatism, polyarthritis, spondylitis, arthritis, gout, neuralgia and muscle tension. These disorders are complex and involve inflam- mation and degeneration of skeletal muscles, bones and joints, often accompanied by severe pain. treatment Because of pain and inflammation, a symptomatic treatment is carried out by inhibiting enzymes of prostaglandin and leucotriene formation, such as cyclooxygenase, and 5-lipoxygenase (e.g. by salicylic acid, iridoid glucosides and derivatives). Another approach uses corticomimetic substances (triterpenes, steroids, and other secondary metabolites) that induce endogenous cortisone formation, and thus block the first step of arachidonic acid release, i.e. or by directly inhibiting phospholipase A2. Immune- modulating and immune-suppressive therapy can also be useful. Traditional medicine employs counter- irritants, drugs against dyscrasia as well as hydrolytic enzymes, such as papain, bromelain, ficin, pepsin, trypsin, amylases and lipases. Phytomedicines for internal use include: nettle leaves (e.g. Rheuma-HEK forte), devil’s claw (e.g. Doloteffin), willow bark (e.g. Assalix), St John’s wort (e.g. Neuroplant 300 mg novo), Indian frankincense (Boswellia serrata, e.g. Sallaki) and the combination product Phytodolor tincture.

Gout An imbalance of uric acid, known as hyperuricemia (>6.5 mg uric acid/ 100 ml serum) is caused by a disorder of the purine metabolism and leads to a precipitation of sodium urate crystals in the synovial fluids of the big toe (hallux), and less common, of the knee, tarsus, wrist and finger joints. These crystals cause an inflam- mation and attract leukocytes and macrophages. Macrophages are lysed when digesting the urate crystals and release lysosomal enzymes that aggravate the inflammation. In addition, leukocytes release lactic acid that lowers the local hydrogen ion concentration and decreases the solubility of urate, thus intensifying its crystallisation. treatment Colchicine is used to stop the vicious cycle: colchicine binds to tubulin and thus inhibits microtubule formation and therefore the motility of macrophages (chemotaxis) which no longer aggregate in the inflamed joints. In addition, colchicine has indirect analgesic properties, as it inhibits the release of 395 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 395 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM prostaglandin. Because colchicine is very toxic (lethal dose 20 mg), not more than 8 mg should be used to treat an acute attack of gout. main plants Colchicum autumnale. Disorders of the endocrine system Menstrual disorders Menstruation (occurring every 28 days) can be too frequent (polymenorrhoea), irregular (oligomenorrhoea), absent (amenorrhoea), painful (dysmenorrhoea), too strong (hypermenorrhoea, menorrhagia) or too weak (hypomenorrhoea). Uterine bleeding that is not connected with menstruation can occur during pregnancy, after birth or may be caused by inflammation, polyps or myomas. treatment This disorder is often caused by hormonal or endocrine disturbances. Therefore, hormones or hormone mimetics are used for therapy, such as oestrogens or gestagens. However, plant medicines may also play a role in this context, for example chaste tree (Vitex agnus-castus, e.g. Agnucaston). Antidysmenorrhoics are medicines that reduce menstrual pains and are often spasmolytic, analgesic, astringent or aim to arrest menstrual bleeding. Other medicines (emmenagoga) induce or enhance menstrual bleeding involving a direct or indirect stimulation of the womb. The latter compounds can induce an abortion at higher concentration and should be avoided during pregnancy. Their use as abortion drugs was previously widespread. main anD traDitional plants Achillea millefolium, Alchemilla vulgaris, Aloe species, Aristolochia clematitis (beware of carcinogenic aristolochic acid!), Atropa belladonna, Brassica nigra, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Chamaemelum nobile, Chelidonium majus, Chrysanthemum vulgare, Cimicifuga racemosa, Cinchona species, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Claviceps purpurea, Cyclamen europaeum, Cytisus scoparius, Equisetum arvense, Erigeron canadensis, Hyoscyamus niger, Inula helenium, Juniperus sabina, Lamium album, Matricaria chamomilla, Melissa officinalis, Myristica fragrans, Petroselinum crispum, Polygonum aviculare, P. hydropiper, Potentilla anserina, Pulsatilla vulgaris, Rhamnus frangula, Ricinus communis, Rosmarinus officinalis, Ruta graveolens, Senecio ovatus (=S. nemorensis; beware of carcinogenic PAs!), Senna alexandrina, Tanacetum vulgare, Viburnum prunifolium, Viscum album, Vitex agnus-castus. Premenstrual tension and climacteric syndrome Premenstrual tension (PMS) occurs a few days before menstrual bleeding and is characterised by anxiety, irritability, change of mood, insomnia, headache, pain in swollen breasts (mastodynia), abdominal pains or oedema in the legs. PMS is caused by an imbalance between progesterone and oestrogen and is strongly influenced by psychosomatic factors. Climacteric syndrome describes a disturbance of women over 45 when ovarian functions diminish. It is characterised by a reduced production of oestrogen and gestagens whereas gonadotropic hormone secretion (FSH, LH) is enhanced. Symptoms of the climacteric syndrome are complex and manifold and include menstrual irregularities, dysfunctional bleeding, hot flushes, profuse perspiration, insomnia and depression. treatment Climacteric syndrome is usually treated with oestrogen or oestrogen/gestagen. For PMS and climacteric problems, plant extracts with hormone mimetics and “phytoestrogens” are also useful. Drugs with isoflavones are phytoestrogenic because the isoflavones are structurally similar to oestrogen and can bind to oestrogen receptors. Psychosomatic side-effects can be treated with antidepressant, spasmolytic and anxiolytic phytomedicines or with plant tonics. Controlled clinical studies with Actaea racemosa, Vitex agnus- castus and Panax ginseng have provided evidence for efficacy in the treatment of PMS and the climacteric syndrome. St John’s wort (e.g. Laif 900) or Pascosedon (from valerian, hops, melissa) help for psychological distress in PMS; Phytodolor tincture (from ash, goldenrod, common aspen) can be used for menstrual pain. main plants Hormone mimetics: Actaea racemosa, Glycine max, Lycopus europaeus, Rheum rhaponticum, Trifolium pratense, Vitex agnus-castus.

Mastitis Inflammation of the breast (mastitis) is usually caused by infection within the breast-feeding period. Mas- todynia refers to a tension of the breast shortly before onset of menstrual bleeding (see PMS). treatment In severe cases of mastitis, antibiotics are required and further lactation is blocked by prolac- tin inhibitors. In traditional medicine, teas with antimicrobial properties have been used. Phytomedicines used internally include Vitex agnus-castus (e.g. Agnucaston), Lycopus europaeus (e.g. Thyreogutt mono) and Echinacea purpurea (e.g. Echinacin Saft Madaus); Hamamelis leaves (e.g. Hametum wound and healing oint- ment) are used as an external treatment. main plants Echinacea purpurea, Hamamelis virginiana, Lycopus europaeus, Vitex agnus-castus. Plants used in traditional medicine: Bellis perennis, Conium maculatum, Humulus lupulus, Juglans regia, Phytolacca americana, Salvia officinalis. Immune system Immunodeficiency or immunosuppression Causes of immunodeficiency and immune suppression can be manifold: wrong nutrition and lifestyle (too little or too much food; lack of movement; extensive sport activity; heavy alcohol and nicotine intake), environmental influences (climatic changes, UV-exposure, toxins), severe burns, certain disorders (diabe- tes, uraemia, tumours, severe allergies), medical treatment (chemotherapy, antibiotic treatment) and psycho-somatic factors. A suppression of the cellular and humoral immune response can result in increased infection and inflammation rates. treatment Known immune deficiencies can be treated by stimulation of cellular and humoral immune responses. As this is a complex field and patients show great individual variation, it is difficult to obtain unequivocal pharmacological evidence for efficacy of phytomedicinal treatments. Immune-stimulating secondary metabolites include polysaccharides, alkylamides, phenolics, triterpenes and non-protein amino acids. Controlled clinical studies with Echinacea and Eleutherococcus extracts indicate some positive thera- peutic effects in the treatment of infections and common cold.

Disorders of the respiratory tract Common cold; rhinitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis and otitis Disorders of the respiratory tract (more than 90%) are caused by various viruses that destroy mucosal cells. The necrotic tissues can secondarily suffer from bacterial infections. Mucosas swell and show an enhanced mucus production. Pollinosis (hay fever) is an allergic disturbance affecting the respiratory tract. This disor- der is often a complex with rhinitis, tracheitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis and acute bronchitis. Rhinitis can lead to sinusitis, a painful inflammation of ethmoidal, frontal, maxillary or sphenoidal sinuses, with congestion, headache and general malaise. Otitis is a painful inflammation of the middle ear (otitis media) or outer ear (otitis externa), caused by bacterial infections. A common cold must be distinguished from viral influenza. The latter disorder is characterised by high fever, intense headache, muscle pains and cough. treatment Mainly symptomatic – products with anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and mucosa-subsiding, mucosa-protectant, antibacterial, demulcent, astringent and immunostimulant properties are widely em- ployed. Phytomedicines are usually applied locally (ointments, balsams or inhalations). Immunomodulatory drugs are taken orally (sometimes locally or parenterally). Monoterpenes such as menthol generate the sensation of cooling, thus relieving the pain and discomfort of cold symptoms. Laryngo-pharyngitis is traditionally treated with mucus-controlling drugs (echinacea, Iceland moss) and anti-inflammatory essential oil (thyme, chamomile). A commercial gargle Salviathymol (from sage, thyme, eucalyptus and peppermint oil) has proven effective for inflammation of the mouth and throat. For sinusitis and ear pain, the proprietary medicinal products Sinupret (contains extracts of verbena, gentian root, elder flower, cowslip and dock), Pinimenthol (essential oils of Eucalyptus, Pinus, plus Levomenthol) and Kamillosan Ocean (chamomile) have proven to be effective. Otitis is traditionally treated with antimicrobial-acting iso- thiocyanates from Tropaeolum and Armoracia (e.g. Angocin Anti-Infekt N) or analgesic extracts of willow bark. In febrile infections, phytotherapy can provide symptomatic relief with pain-alleviating and fever-suppress- ing drugs, for example extracts of willow bark and meadowsweet. Various “immunostimulants” (especially Echinacea, Eleutherococcus, Panax ginseng) are traditionally used for prevention. For a headache, peppermint oil can be used, and for circulatory weakness camphor and hawthorn. Traditionally, lime and elderberry blossoms are used to induce sweating. Ingredients of traditional teas to treat colds include elderberry and linden (lime) blossoms, meadowsweet and rosehips.

Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is caused by viral, bacterial or fungal infections and is characterised by a disturbance of bronchial mucosa, including hyperaemia, oedema, cell death, increased mucus production, cough and dysp-noea. Chronic bronchitis may result from relapsing infections, chronic sinusitis, bronchial allergies and excessive smoking. It is characterised initially by cough and expectoration, then by dyspnoea and respira- tory insufficiency and in severe cases by obstructive emphysema. Acute bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which needs to be treated with antibiotics. A distinction is made between unproductive cough (dry, little mucus formation) and productive cough (strong mucus formation). 398 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 398 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM treatment Most phytomedicines used to treat bronchitis are mixtures of several drugs that are taken orally, by inhalation (essential oils) or topical application (in case of lipophilic essential oils). As an adjuvant therapy to antibiotics and chemotherapy, drugs that stimulate the immune system (immunostimulants) and physical measures (inhalation, topical application, and wet packs) can be useful. Topically applied phytomedicines may have expectorant, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic and disinfectant properties. Expec- torant drugs can be rich in saponins or the alkaloid emetine, saponins are not absorbed but stimulate the nervus vagus in the stomach. In a reflectory way this stimulation leads to a secretion of water in the bronchia that dilutes the mucus; a secretolytic effect results. Drugs with essential oils stimulate secretion of bronchial endothelia (secretolytic effect) and enhance ciliary activity (secretomotoric effect). Anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic and disinfectant activities can be further beneficial properties of mono- terpenes, sesquiterpenes and phenylpropanoids present in essential oils. In addition, saponins may exhibit corticomimetic effects. Salicylic acid derivatives present in Viola and Primula and iridoid glucosides in Ver- bena, Plantago and Veronica may enhance the anti-inflammatory properties. Clinical studies, for example with the special extract EPs 7630 from Pelargonium sidoides, provide evidence for the efficacy of essential oils and saponins in treating bronchitis. Phytomedicines for non-productive cough include ivy, marsh- mallow and ribwort plantain (proprietary medicinal products: Prospan, Phythustil, Broncho Sern); for produc- tive cough, ivy, thyme, cowslip, nasturtium and horseradish (proprietary medicinal products: Bronchipret, Phytobronchin, Angocin); and essential oils for inhalation and rubbing (proprietary medicinal products: Bronchofortan, Pinimentol, Tumarol-N-balsam). Traditional teas for colds are made with anise fruits, liquorice and marshmallow root and leaves to relieve irritation, and bitter fennel, ribwort plantain, liquorice and thyme to loosen the phlegm. main anD traDitional plants Saponin and iridoid drugs: Castanea sativa, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Gypsophila paniculata, Hedera helix, Plantago lanceolata, Polygala senega, Primula elatior, P. veris, Pulmo- naria officinalis, Rumex crispus, Saponaria officinalis, Verbena officinalis, Veronica officinalis, Viola tricolor.

Asthma Asthma (Asthma bronchiale) is a complex disorder. It is influenced by infections, toxins and allergens that cause a chronic inflammation but also by stress and other psychosomatic factors. Bronchial hyperreactivity is intermediary to asthma bronchiale. An asthma attack starts with the release of cellular mediators from mast cells, granulocytes and macrophages, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, bradykinine, histamine and others. These compounds induce a contraction of smooth bronchial muscles, and enhance mucus and oedema formation. treatment Causal treatment may include the avoidance of allergens, a specific hyposensitisation, an anti-infective and psychotherapy. A symptomatic treatment involves the application of bronchodilatory, expectorant, antitussive and anti-inflammatory medicines. In case of status asthmaticus (severe attack) glucocorticoids and isolated alkaloids such as theophylline (broncholytic by inhibition of phosphodiesterase and histamine secretion) and atropine (sympatholytic; spasmolytic on smooth bronchial muscles) (and their derivatives) are used. Ephedrine is an indirect sym- pathomimetic that enhances the release of noradrenaline with bronchodilatory properties. Otherwise, plant extracts with weaker activities can be applied. main plants Ammi visnaga, Atropa belladonna, Camellia sinensis, Datura stramonium, Ephedra distachya and other species, Hyoscyamus niger.

Whooping cough (pertussis) is caused by an infection with Bordetella pertussis. Cough can be a burden on the heart and circulation. treatment Cough is a reflex that helps to eliminate (expel) mucus or foreign bodies from the bronchial tract. A complete inhibition of cough is therefore not advisable. Antitussives are indicated in cases of unproductive and distressing cough, especially at night, and dry irritating cough. In the case of productive cough, i.e. when mucus is produced, antitussives are no longer required. Cough can be silenced centrally by affecting the neuronal “cough centre” in the Medulla oblongata (e.g. by isolated alkaloids codeine and noscap- ine). Most phytomedicines (with mucilage, essential oils) affect peripheral targets, such as nerves in the throat; they are “calmed down” so that cough irritation is suppressed. Plants with quinones such as plumbagin and droserone have been used to treat pertussis. Phytomedicines that are used to treat bronchitis are also relevant and often useful for relieving cough and irritating cough. main anD traDitional plants (see also bronchitis) Drosera ramentacea, D. rotundifolia, Ephedra distachya, Papaver somniferum, Rhododendron tomentosum (=Ledum palustre). Plants with mucilages: Althaea officinalis, Cetraria islandica, Malva neglecta, M. sylvestris, Plantago lanceolata, Trigonella foenum-graecum, Tus- silago farfara, Verbascum densiflorum and others. Mucosal inflammation Mucosa of the mouth and respiratory tract are subject to viral, bacterial and fungal infections that can lead to painful inflammation. Difficulty in swallowing and speaking, painful lymph nodes, hoarseness and swollen tissues are typical symptoms of gingivitis, stomatitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis and tonsillitis. treatment Treatment with phytomedicines is symptomatic and mainly external, by using extracts for gargling, rinsing or inhalation. Several plant medicines used for this indication have anti-inflammatory effects (e.g. essential oils such as chamomile, sage and thyme). Plants that contain tannins (e.g. rhatany, Potentilla erecta, myrrh) promote wound healing and have an astringent effect. Drugs with tannins, essential oils and mustard oils have antibacterial properties, thus a mild disinfectant effect can also be achieved. Drugs with mucilage used to treat mucosal irritation (marshmallow, mallow) play a role in pharyngitis and laryngitis. main anD traDitional plants Plants with essential oils: Achillea millefolium, Chamaemelum nobile, Commiphora erythraea, C. myrrha and others, Eucalyptus globulus, Foeniculum vulgare, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha ×piperita, Salvia officinalis, S. triloba, Santalum album, Syzygium aromaticum, Thymus vulgaris.

Plants with anti-inflammatory metabolites: Matricaria chamomilla, Plantago lanceolata, Solidago virgaurea, Viola tricolor. Disorders of the skin Wounds and haematoma A distinction is made between primary wounds – caused by cuts, stabs, abrasions and scratches – and second- ary wounds – caused by bites, fissures, burns or contusions (bruises with damaged veins below intact skin). Primary wounds heal within six to eight days without loss of tissue after a scab or scurf has been formed. Secondary wounds are slower to heal since new tissue (granulation tissue) has to be formed and the process is often accompanied by infections and haematomas. treatment Wounds are treated with medicines or medicinal plants that have haemostyptic, disinfectant, wound-cleaning, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. Some of these may also promote the formation of granulation tissue and new epithelia. Responsible compounds include flavonoids, tannins, essential oils, sesquiterpenes, saponins, allantoin, benzoylesters, alkylamides, polysaccharides (e.g. mucilage), fatty oils and enzymes (e.g. papain, bromelain). 400 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 400 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM In phytotherapy, St John’s wort oil (e.g. Red Oil; Jukunda), Hamamelis leaves (e.g. Hametum extract, Hametum cream), marigold flowers (e.g. Calendumed cream or ointment), echinacea (e.g. Echinacin oint- ment) and chamomile (e.g. Kamillosan cream or ointment) are used. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Hamamelis extracts. main anD traDitional plants Achillea millefolium, Allium cepa, Aloe vera, Ananas comosus, Arnica montana, Artemisia abrotanum, Bellis perennis, Calendula officinalis, Carica papaya, Centella asiatica, Cinnamo- mum camphora, Commiphora myrrha, Echinacea species, Eucalyptus globulus, Hamamelis virginiana, Hypericum perforatum, Juglans regia, Krameria lappacea, Marrubium vulgare, Matricaria chamomilla, Melaleuca alternifolia, Myroxylon balsamum, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus robur, Rhododendron tomentosum (=Ledum palustre), Rosmarinus officinalis, Symphytum officinale, Syzygium aromaticum, Verbena officinalis. Infections (bacteria, fungi, viruses) The skin can be infected by fungi (e.g. Candida), bacteria, and certain viruses (e.g. Herpes labialis, Herpes zoster). treatment Fungi can be treated with specific antimycotics, bacteria with antibiotics, and viruses with virustatic or virucidal medicines. Usually, classical antibiotics and chemotherapeutics are used for treatment, since the activity of plant extracts is often too low to overcome severe infections. Nevertheless, plants with phenolics (such as rosmarinic acid), tannins, essential oils, phenylpropanoids (e.g. eugenol), saponins and some alkaloids (e.g. berberine, sanguinarine) exhibit substantial disinfectant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties. Melissa officinalis extracts with rosmarinic acid (proprietary medicinal product, e.g. Lomaherpan cream) and echinacea (e.g. Echinacin Liquidum) are used against Herpes labialis. main anD traDitional plants Allium sativum, Berberis vulgaris, Cinnamomum camphora, C. verum, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus species, Lessertia frutescens, Mahonia aquifolium, Matricaria chamomilla, Me- laleuca alternifolia and related species, Melissa officinalis, Mentha ×piperita and related species, Myroxylon balsamum, Pinus sylvestris and related species, Sanguinaria canadensis, Syzygium aromaticum, Thuja occidentalis, Thymus vulgaris. Psoriasis Psoriasis is a complex disorder (influenced by inherited and psychosomatic factors) and characterised by an enhanced proliferation of epidermal cells (keratocytes) that leads to the extensive production of scales. This disorder is often accompanied by inflammation of the skin. treatment Psoriasis is mainly treated symptomatically. Inflammation can be controlled by anti-inflam- matory medicines and the proliferation of epidermal cells by chemotherapy. Synthetic drugs can be used, but phytotherapy also plays a role in the treatment of psoriasis. Plants with cytotoxic alkaloids, such as berberine (e.g. in Mahonia aquifolium; proprietary medicinal product: Rubisan), with dianthranols (mostly synthetic today; formerly from Andira araroba), or with phototoxic furanocoumarins (e.g. abundant in members of the Apiaceae) are employed. Salicylic acid is sometimes added to induce intense keratolysis. Furanocoumarins, such as 8-methoxypsoralen, are lipophilic and easily penetrate the skin. Inside the cells, furanocoumarins intercalate DNA. If the skin is then exposed to UV light (360 nm) these compounds are activated and can form covalent bonds with thymine bases in the DNA. The alkylation stops DNA replication and induces cell death. Long-term utilisation of this treatment (known as phototherapy), which uses mainly isolated compounds such as 8-methoxypsoralen, can cause skin cancer. Salicylic acid has also been used to treat psoriasis because of its keratolytic properties; vitamin A derivatives, such as retinoids can influence inflam- mation and cell proliferation. In traditional medicine, tars produced from Betula, Fagus, Juniperus and other woody plants, which contain cytotoxic phenols, cresols, anthracenes and naphthalins, have been employed. main plants Ammi majus, Angelica archangelica, Levisticum officinale, Mahonia aquifolium. Plants used in traditional medicine: Tars from Betula, Fagus, Juniperus; extracts containing steroidal saponins of Andira araroba, Centella asiatica, Smilax aristolochiifolia, S. ornata. 401 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 401 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM Vitiligo Vitiligo is characterised by the occurrence of white patches on the skin that can be round or irregular in shape. The origin of vitiligo is uncertain but has been linked to disorders of the nervous system or an inhibi- tion of pigment formation by genetic or immunological factors. treatment Furanocoumarins, such as psoralen, in combination with UV light (UV-A) induce repigmen- tation of skin parts with vitiligo. Carotenoids, such as -carotene or canthaxanthin, are deposited in the epidermis and can slightly compensate for the pigment deficiency. main plants Plants with furanocoumarins (see psoriasis). Eczema, neurodermatitis, haemorrhoids, other inflammations Eczemas are dermal inflammations that affect either the epidermis or cutaneous-vascular tissues. Certain types affect the skin epidermis, e.g. contact dermatitis, allergies and contact eczema, diaper dermatitis and atopic dermatitis (neurodermatitis). The second type of dermatitis includes exanthema caused by chemicals and medicines, plant allergies, urticaria, Quincke’s oedema and photoallergies. treatment If allergens are responsible for eczema, the obvious treatment is to avoid such allergens in food, cosmetics or the environment. Chronic eczema can be caused by disturbances of the metabolism and a sensible treatment is to improve the basic underlying problems and to induce physiological changes. Treatment with medicinal plants includes the topical application of fatty ointments to protect the skin from unspecific irritations, anti-inflammatory compounds (that block the cascade leading to prostaglandins and leucotrienes; e.g. salicylic acid and corticomimetics) and compounds that suppress itching. Severe allergic skin disorders are usually treated with antihistamines and corticoids. Secondary plant metabolites used to treat eczema include flavonoids, tannins, essential oils, sesquiterpenes, saponins, allantoin, benzoylesters, salicylic acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides (e.g. mucilage). Skin inflammation with itching may be treated internally with Solanum dulcamara (e.g. Cefabene); exter- nally areas of inflamed skin are treated with balloon vine (Cardiospermum halicacabum, e.g. Halicar cream), oak tree bark, chamomile (e.g. Kamillosan), witch hazel (e.g. Hametum) and Mahonia aquifolium (e.g. Rubisan). Oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids (linolic and linoleic acid) that are precursors for the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid (used to make prostaglandins and leucotrienes) have been employed to treat neuroderma- titis. Internally, evening primrose oil (e.g. Epogam 1000 mg) or borage seed oil are used. main plants Arnica montana, Cardiospermum halicacabum, Echinacea pallida and related species, Hama- melis virginiana, Linum usitatissimum, Matricaria chamomilla, Oenothera biennis, Quercus robur, Smilax ornata, Solanum dulcamara, Viola tricolor.. Plants used in traditional medicine: Anacardium occidentale, Borago officinalis, Chelidonium majus, Croton tiglium, Daphne mezereum, Euphrasia officinalis, Fagopyrum esculentum, Galium species, Juglans regia, Urtica dioica. Pruritus and insect bites Pruritus or unpleasant itching is a symptom of most dermal disorders. It can also be symptomatic of a meta- bolic disorder, such as diabetes, icterus, renal failure and gout. Pruritus can also be caused by allergens or insect bites. Itching occurs when cellular mediators, such as histamine, bradykinin or prostaglandins are released and interact with corresponding receptors. The stings or bites of various insects may induce the release of these mediators. treatment Medicinal plants or isolated plant products (menthol, thymol, camphor) are used to reduce itching by local cooling, anaesthetic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory or astringent effects. main plants Cinnamomum camphora, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha species, Thymus vulgaris, Viola tricolor. Plants used in traditional medicine: Allium cepa, Cardiospermum halicacabum, Fagopy- rum esculentum, Mucuna pruriens, Plantago lanceolata. Extracts from honeybees (Apis mellifera) are also used. 402 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 402 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM Acne, seborrhoea Acne is a complex disorder, often prevalent during puberty. It is characterised by an enhanced sebum produc- tion (seborrhoea) and an increased cornification of the follicles (hyperkeratosis). Acne is often accompanied by inflammation and bacterial infections (by Corynebacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis) of the follicle. Sebum production is stimulated by dihydrotestosterone, an androgen derived from testosterone. treatment Acne is treated topically by reducing sebum production (e.g. by vitamin A acid, anti- androgens), by eliminating the cornification (e.g. with salicylic acid and retinoids) and by eradicating the bacterial infections (e.g. with antibiotics, such as erythromycin and tetracycline). Plants containing salicylic acid or antibacterial alkaloids, saponins and anthranoids can also be used. For example, Ilon Abscess Oint- ment is used for local therapy. To strengthen immune defence, the preparation Mutaflor (contains E. coli) is recommended as the basic therapy, internally also Agnucaston (from Vitex agnus-castus) and echinacea (e.g. Echinacin Liquidum). Externally, treatments with chamomile (e.g. Kamillosan Concentrate 1:10), witch hazel (e.g. Hametum extract), and Mahonia aquifolium bark (e.g. Rubisan cream) have proven effective. main anD traDitional plants Aloe ferox, Aloe vera, Bellis perennis, Chelidonium majus, Equisetum arvense, Filipendula ulmaria, Fumaria officinalis, Hamamelis virginiana, Juglans regia, Mahonia aquifolium, Matricaria chamomilla, Ononis repens, Stellaria media, Viola tricolor, Vitex agnus-castus. Hyperhidrosis Enhanced or excessive perspiration is known as hyperhidrosis. It can be caused by internal, psychic and external factors. treatment External treatment utilises drugs rich in tannins and salicylic acid. Internally, essential oils (such as extracts from Salvia officinalis) and tropane alkaloids have been used. Tropane alkaloids block muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and thus the smooth muscles of sweat glands. Phytotherapeutically, hyperhidrosis may be treated with bugleweed (e.g. Thyreogutt mono), hawthorn (e.g. Crataegutt novo 450 mg), Actaea (e.g., Klimadynon uno) and sage leaves (e.g. Salvysat plus). A hand/foot bath with oak bark extract is recommended against sweating hands and feet. main anD traDitional plants Atropa belladonna and other species with tropane alkaloids, Actaea racemosa, Crataegus monogyna, Lycopus europaeus, Quercus robur, Salvia officinalis, Viola tricolor. Warts and Condylomata acuminata Warts and Condylomata acuminata (warts occurring on genitalia) are caused by viruses of the papilloma group (HPV=Human Papilloma Virus) that induce the growth of their host cells. Warts can also result from hyperkeratosis, an excessive cornification of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot. treatment Painful plantar warts are removed surgically, whereas other warts are removed by local etching and peeling treatments. A more conservative treatment with plant extracts has been used in traditional medicine. Salicylic acid has a substantial keratolytic effect, whereas the lignan podophyllotoxin (in extracts of Podophyllum peltatum; proprietary medicinal product: Condylox solution) and the alkaloid sanguinarine (in Chelidonium majus or Sanguinaria canadensis) exhibit virucidal properties. main plants Podophyllum peltatum. Plants used in traditional medicine: Chelidonium majus, Lycopodium annotinum, Sanguinaria canadensis, Thuja occidentalis. Disorders of the eye Disorders of the eye comprise a wide range of disturbances. Glaucoma is a complex condition characterised by an enhanced inner eye pressure that can lead to reduced vision and blindness. Inflammation can affect the iris (iritis), the uvea (uveitis) and cornea (keratitis); symptoms are local pain, enhanced production of tears, avoidance of light, spasms of the eyelids (blepharospasm) and disturbance of vision. In addition, the conjunctiva and the eyelid (blepharo-conjunctivitis) and the retina (retinopathy) can become inflamed. A special case is retinopathies caused by diabetes. 403 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 403 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM treatment The treatment of glaucoma is aimed at the reduction of intra-ocular pressure. The plant alkaloids pilocarpine (activates mAChR) and physostigmine (inhibits AChE) are parasympathomimetics and stimulate the contraction of eye muscles (M. ciliaris, M. sphincter pupillae). Atropine and scopolamine are parasympatholytics and inhibit the ciliary muscle (mydriatic). These alkaloids are used to treat iritis, uveitis and keratitis and are useful for eye diagnostics. Inflammations of conjunctiva and the eyelid (and eye infections) have been treated with plant-derived substances that exhibit antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities, such as the alkaloid berberine and extracts containing saponins, essential oils and tannins; also Euphrasia, Chelidonium, Hamamelis and Echinacea. Flavonoids, such as rutin (or synthetic derivatives, such as troxerutin) prevent internal bleeding and oedema and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. It is used for diabetic retinopathies. Ginkgo and hawthorn preparations can be useful for vascular and macular degenera- tion. Camphor, rue and Siberian ginseng may be used for “tired eyes”. main plants Atropa belladonna; Berberis vulgaris, Crataegus monogyna, Datura stramonium, Eleutherococ- cus senticosus, Ginkgo biloba, Physostigma venenosum, Pilocarpus jaborandi; rutin from Fagopyrum esculentum, Styphnolobium japonicum or Ruta graveolens. Plants used in traditional medicine: Aesculus hippocastanum, Allium cepa, Arnica montana, Chelidonium majus, Cinnamomum camphora, Euphrasia officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, Hamamelis virginiana, Matricaria chamomilla, Prunus spinosa, Rosa canina, Ruta graveolens. Parasitic infections Especially in the tropics, humans suffer from various parasitic infections. Common ones include malaria (caused by Plasmodium), amoebiasis (caused by amoebas), schistosomiasis (caused by schistosomes), sleep- ing sickness (caused by trypanosomes), filariasis (caused by Filaria) and various types of intestinal worms. treatment Most drugs that affect an intestinal parasite will also affect the host. Amoebas have been treated with emetine from Psychotria (it inhibits protein biosynthesis and intercalates DNA) and malaria with quinine from Cinchona (inhibits parasitic metabolism and is also a DNA intercalating agent) or artemisinin from Artemisia annua. Intestinal worms have traditionally been treated with extracts from ferns (Dryopteris filix-mas) and higher plants (Artemisia cina, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Tanacetum vulgare). Alkaloid-rich extracts from Punica granatum have been used against internal worm infestations. main anD traDitional plants Artemisia maritima and related species, Artemisia annua, A. cina, Chenopodium ambrosioides var. anthelminticum, Cinchona succirubra and related species, Dryopteris filix-mas, Psychotria ipecacuanha and related species, Tanacetum vulgare. Pain Intense pain Some diseases and disorders (such as cancer), fractures, wounds and surgery are accompanied by heavy pain. treatment A very potent strategy is the modulation of endorphin receptors with morphine, an opium alkaloid. Opium alkaloids are highly addictive and must therefore be used with special care. Cocaine blocks sodium channels while aconitine opens them. Both drugs therefore suppress neuronal signal transduction and thus have a local analgesic effect. main plants Morphine from Papaver somniferum, cocaine from Erythroxylum coca, Aconitum napellus and related species. Migraine and neuralgia The pathophysiology of migraine, which affects more women than men, is not fully understood, but involves a disturbance of cerebral blood circulation. Migraine headaches can be accompanied by neurological and somatic disturbances (including nausea and emesis). Neuralgia refers to pains along the nerves, which occur in discrete attacks. The pathophysiology is complex. treatment Serotonin agonists appear to have a positive influence on migraine and promote vasocon- striction of cerebral arteries. Phytomedicines with these properties include ergot alkaloids from Claviceps 404 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 404 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM purpurea (such as ergotamine). Ginkgo and feverfew are recommended for headaches and migraine pain. Neuralgia is mainly treated symptomatically, using analgesic drugs, including phytochemicals. The following herbal medicines have proven useful: for external use, peppermint oil, camphor, eucalyptus and turpentine oil, comfrey extract and capsaicin-containing ointments applied on the forehead, temples or neck; willow bark, devil’s claw, feverfew, ginkgo and St John’s wort are taken internally to alleviate headache. Herbal pain relievers are often characterised by a favourable benefit-risk profile and are therefore suitable for long- term therapy. Neuralgia (e.g. trigeminal pain) has traditionally been treated with Aconitum napellus or the isolated aconitine. In the case of toothache, clove oil or the eugenol isolated from it, has proven effective. Neuralgic toothache can be treated with St John’s wort and if pain is caused by gum disease or implants, ointment extracts from Salvia can be used. main anD traDitional plants Aconitum napellus, Actaea racemosa, Capsicum frutescens, Claviceps purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus, Pinus sylvestris, Gelsemium sempervirens, Harpagophytum procumbens, Hyperi- cum perforatum, Iris versicolor, Mentha ×piperita, Petasites hybridus, Salvia officinalis, Sanguinaria canadensis, Symphytum officinale, Syzygium aromaticum, Tanacetum parthenium. Cancer Cancer comprises a large variety of malignant tumours that can affect nearly all organs of the body. Carci- nomas are of epithelial origin. From a primary tumour, metastases can spread to other tissues and organs. Cancer is fatal if a tumour destroys the function of a vital organ. treatment Treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cancer cells usually divide much faster than “normal” cells. Therefore, compounds that stop cell division (e.g. alkaloids, such as vinblastine, vincristine, taxol, camptothecin, colchicine, demecolcine, or the lignan podophyllotoxin and partial synthetic derivatives) or compounds that kill cells (cytotoxic substances), are the two most commonly employed means of chemotherapy. Because of high toxicity and small therapeutic indices, extracts from plants are no longer used but rather isolated chemical entities. Another approach uses immune stimulants and cytotoxic peptides, e.g. viscotoxins or mistletoe lectins from Viscum album. Results from clinical studies are contradictory; a few show an enhanced survival rate after mistletoe treatment. Actinic keratoses of the skin, which can lead to skin cancer, can be treated by a phorbol ester from Euphorbia peplus (Ingenol mebutate). In brain tumours, boswellic acids from Indian frankincense appear to inhibit lipoxygenase, which is strongly expressed in the tumour cells, and trigger apoptosis. An unspecific stimulation of the immune system by polysaccharides (from Echinacea species, certain mushrooms, e.g. Lentinus edodes, Schizophyllum commune, Coriolus versicolor) and quinones (from Dionaea, Handroanthus) has been postulated. Ginseng and Siberian ginseng improve the general condition and convalescence. The drug Dronabinol (from Cannabis sativa) and ginger help against vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite and cachexia (weakness and wasting of the body). Milk-thistle extracts (e.g. the proprietary medicinal products Silimarit, Legalon) can stabilise the liver function in chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hawthorn preparations can protect against chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. Actaea can reduce unwanted side-effects in breast cancer patients undergoing antihormonal therapy; the proprietary medicinal product Esberitox N (from Baptisia, Thuja, Echinacea) is used to treat white blood cell deficiency. St John’s wort can be taken for depres- sion, marshmallow root extract (e.g. Phytohustil syrup) can bring relief from inflamed mucous membranes in the mouth, and uzara helps against diarrhoea with spasms (e.g. Uzara 2-2-2-2 Drug). Phytodolor (from the butterbur) is given for pain, bromelain (e.g. Bromelain-POS) helps against lymphedema swelling and St John’s wort oil (e.g. Red Oil; Jukunda) can be used for scar tissue pain and neuralgia. main plants from Which chemotherapy Drugs are isolateD Camptotheca acuminata, Cathar- anthus roseus, Colchicum autumnale, Euphorbia peplus, Podophyllum peltatum, P. hexandrum, Taxus baccata, T. brevifolia, Viscum album.

However, their formation can be intensified by exogenously triggered factors, especially infection, radiation, drugs, cigarette smoke and en- vironmental toxins. ROS are thought to play a pathophysiological role in aging and many diseases because ROS can oxidise proteins, lipids, DNA (causing mutations) as well as glutathione and thereby disturb the metabolism. ROS include the hydroxyl anion, the hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and free oxygen. ROS may be implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndrome, and may play an important role in infectivity and aging. treatment Many traditional medicinal plants contain active antioxidative secondary substances, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, flavonoids, tannins and other polyphenols, which can inactivate ROS in vivo. This property should contribute to the overall effect of many drugs. Antioxidatively active substances are increasingly marketed today in a number of food supplements (functional foods) as “anti-aging” prepara- tions and for disease prevention (e.g. cancer). However, convincing clinical studies showing efficacy in these indications are lacking, especially as the bioavailability of the mostly polar antioxidants (e.g. polyphenols) is rather low. main plants that contain antioxiDants Allium sativum, A. cepa, Aronia melanocarpa, Aspalathus linearis, Camellia sinensis, Citrus species, Coffea arabica, Cola acuminata, Cyclopia intermedia, Daucus carota, Euterpe oleracea (açaí berries), Garcinia mangostana (mangosteen), Hibiscus sabdariffa, Hippophae rhamnoides, Humulus lupulus, Ilex paraguariensis, Lycium chinense (goji berries), Malpighia emarginata (acerola), Malus domestica, Morinda citrifolia (noni fruit), Paullinia cupana, Pistacia vera, Prunus species, Punica granatum, Ribes nigrum, Rosa species (rose hips), Solanum esculentum, Theobroma cacao, Vaccinium myrtillus, V. macrocarpon, Vitis vinifera (red wine, grapeseed oil). 406 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 406 6/5/2017 11:08:40 AM OVERVIEW OF SECONDARY METABOLITES AND THEIR EFFECTS O O R 7 R 4 R 3 R 5 R 6 OH R O 1 R 2 Common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) 407 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 407 6/5/2017 11:08:42 AM OVERVIEW OF SECONDARY METABOLITES AND THEIR EFFECTS Secondary metabolites or “natural products” are low-molecular weight compounds that do not play a role in pri- mary plant metabolism. They constitute the active ingredients of medicinal plants. Although approximately only 20% of higher plants have been investigated in some depth so far, several ten thousands of secondary metabolites (see Table below) have already been isolated and their structures determined by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance or X-ray diffraction. Two major groups of secondary metabolites can be recognised: nitrogen- containing substances and nitrogen-free substances. Over 30 000 nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites have been described so far. Alkaloids, amines, non-protein amino acids, cyanogenic glucosides, mustard oil glycosides (glucosinolates) and peptides (lectins, protease inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides) and glucosinolates are the main compounds in this group.

Both these means are apparently not available to plants when attacked by herbivores, microbes (bacteria, fungi) and even other plants competing for light, space and nutrients. Plants have evolved numerous defence strategies. The major one is the production of secondary metabolites, which have no direct function in growth or development or primary processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, assimi- lation of nutrients, transport or differentiation, but serve for protection against viruses, bacteria, fungi, competing plants and importantly, against herbivores (e.g. nematodes, slugs and snails, arthropods, vertebrates). In addition, secondary metabolites can serve as signal compounds to attract animals for pollination (fragrant monoterpenes; coloured anthocyanins or carotenoids) and seed dispersal. In addition, some secondary metabolites concomitantly exhibit physiological functions, for example they can serve as UV-protection, as antioxidants or as mobile (but poisonous) nitrogen transport and storage substances. Besides chemical defence a number of plants use mechanical and morphological features for protection, such as thorns, spikes, glandular and stinging hairs (often filled with noxious chemicals), or develop an almost impen- etrable bark (especially woody perennials). Secondary substances have been selected as biologically active substances in the evolution of plants. This is the only reason for using secondary substances from plants for infections and diseases. We have to know the secondary metabolites present in a medicinal plant and their biological activities in order to understand and evaluate the effects and efficacy of phytomedicines. ALkALOIDS AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION Formerly, this class of secondary compounds was restricted to plant bases (if the free base is dissolved in water, an alkaline pH results) with a heterocyclic nitrogen atom. Exocyclic nitrogen bases were termed “pseudo-alkaloids”. Other definitions demanded that the skeleton of alkaloids should derive from amino acids or that these bases have pharmacological activities. At present, the definition is much more pragmatic and includes all nitrogen- containing natural products which are not otherwise classified as peptides, antibiotics, non-protein amino acids, amines, cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates, cofactors, phytohormones or primary metabolites (such as purine and pyrimidine bases). Alkaloids have been detected in more than 15% of plants, but also occur in bacteria, fungi, and even in animals. Within the Plant Kingdom, they are found in ancient (basal) groups such as Lycopodium or Equisetum, and in higher plants such as in gymnosperms and angiosperms. In angiosperms some families contain more alkaloidal taxa than others: alkaloid-rich families include the Amaryllidaceae, Papaveraceae, Berberidaceae, Colchicaceae, Fabaceae, Boraginaceae, Apocynaceae (including Asclepiadoideae), Asteraceae, Gnetaceae, Magnoliaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rubiaceae, Solanaceae, Rutaceae and others. Alkaloids are stored predominantly in tissues that are important for survival and reproduction of the plant producing them, which include actively growing young tissues, root and stem bark, flowers (especially seeds), seedlings and photosynthetically active tissues. In general, alkaloid levels are markedly reduced in senescing tissues, so that fallen leaves are often nearly alkaloid-free. The alkaloid contents in storing organs can be quite high, reaching up to 10% of dry weight in some instances. In several herbaceous plants, alkaloids are stored in epidermal and subepidermal tissues (for example, cocaine, colchicine, aconitine, steroidal alkaloids, nicotine, veratrine, buxine, coniine, lupanine) that have to ward off small enemies (insects, microorganisms) as a first line of defence. To reach these sites of accumulation, short- and long-distance transport via xylem or phloem is required. A number of plants produce latex, which often contains defence chemicals such as alkaloids (morphine and related benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in Papaveraceae; protoberberine and benzophenanthridine alkaloids in Chelidonium; lobeline and other piperidine alkaloids in Lobelia) and terpenoids (e.g. phorbol esters). Alkaloid patterns usually vary between the site of synthesis and the sites of accumulation, since a number of secondary substitutions may take place in the latter tissues. Or transport may be selective, resulting in differing alkaloid profiles in sink organs. In addition, alkaloid profiles of seeds and seedlings often differ from those of the mature plant. Both patterns and concentrations usually change during the development of plants and the annual cycle. In general, alkaloids are not end products of metabolism but can be degraded to serve as a nitrogen source when needed. This seems to be plausible because nitrogen is a limited nutrient for plants. Alkaloids stored in seeds are partly degraded dur- ing germination and seedling development and their nitrogen is probably used for the synthesis of amino acids. Knowledge of this alkaloidal variation in plants is important in the production of plant medicine because it allows the plants to be collected and harvested at the right time and the right growth stage. Alkaloids are certainly multipurpose compounds (multi-target drugs) which, depending on the situation, may be active in more than one environmental interaction, e.g. as defence compounds against herbivorous animals, bacteria, fungi, viruses or competing plants. Alkaloids are especially infamous as neurotoxins but also represent the active 409 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 409 6/5/2017 11:08:44 AM principle of many medicinal plants. The various steps in neuronal signalling and signal transduction, which are unique for animals, provide central targets that are affected by several amines and alkaloids. Targets can be: The neurotransmitter receptors itself. Agonists mimic the function of a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine, do- pamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, glycine, endorphines, peptides) by binding to its receptor and causing the normal response. Antagonists (often called “blocker”) also bind to the receptor but act as an inhibitor of the natural ligand by competing for binding sites on the receptor, thereby blocking the physiological response. Voltage-gated Na+, K+ and Ca2+-channels. The enzymes which deactivate neurotransmitters after they have bound to a receptor, such as acetylcholine esterase, monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase. Transport processes which are important for the uptake and release of the neurotransmitters in the presynapse or synaptic vesicles. Also Na+, K+ and Ca2+-ATPases, which restore the ion gradients after depolarisation, must be considered in this category. Modulation of key enzymes of signal pathways: – adenylyl cyclase (making cAMP) – phosphodiesterase (inactivating cAMP or cGMP) – phospholipase C (releasing inositol phosphates such as IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG)) – several protein kinases, such as protein kinase C or tyrosine kinase (which phosphorylate other regulatory enzymes or ion channels). Since alkaloids often derive from the same amino acid precursor as the neurotransmitters serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, GABA, glutamic acid or histamine, their structures can often be superimposed on those of neuro- transmitters. Other alkaloids are planar and lipophilic; they intercalate DNA (berberine, sanguinarine, emetine). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids and aristolochic acid alkylate DNA after metabolic activation in the liver. Colchicine, vinblastine and taxol inhibit the assembly or disassembly of microtubules. Some alkaloids that intercalate and/ or affect microtubules, induce apoptosis (programmed cell death). Indolizidine alkaloids inhibit carbohydrate processing enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is apparent that alkaloid toxicity and pharmacological activity in animals and humans are clearly correlated with their interactions with particular molecular targets.

NPAAs are especially abundant in the family Fabaceae and several monocotyledonous families (lily-like groups). Organs rich in these metabolites are seeds (Fabaceae) or rhizomes (monocots). Concentrations in seeds can exceed 8% of dry weight and up to 50% of the nitrogen present can be attribted to them. Since NPAAs are often (at least partly) remobilised during germination, they certainly function as nitrogen-storage compounds in addition to their role as defence chemicals. NPAAs often figure as antinutrients or antimetabolites. Many non-protein amino acids resemble protein amino acids and quite often can be considered to be their structural analogues and may interfere with the human metabolism: In ribosomal protein biosynthesis NPAAs can be accepted in place of the normal amino acid leading to defec- tive proteins. NPAAs may competitively inhibit uptake systems for amino acids. NPAAs can inhibit amino acid biosynthesis by substrate competition or by mimicking end product mediated feedback inhibition of earlier key enzymes in the pathway. NPAAs may affect other targets, such as DNA-, RNA-related processes (canavanine, mimosine), receptors of neurotransmitters, inhibit collagen biosynthesis (mimosine), or -oxidation of lipids (L-hypoglycine). L-Arginine Canavanine L-Proline L-Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid Canavanine is a structural analogue of L-arginine and is widely distributed amongst legumes. L-Azetidine- 2-carboxylic acid occurs widely in monocots and functions as a structural analogue of L-proline. alliinase Alliin Allicin In garlic and onions (Amaryllidaceae) a NPAA is present, better known as alliin. Upon tissue damage alliin is converted enzymatically into allicin, a diallylsulfide. Allylsulfide is quite reactive and can form disulfide bridges with SH-groups of proteins. This would explain the wide range of pharmacological activities that were attributed to garlic and onion preparations (including the anti-atherosclerotic activity). 417 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 417 6/5/2017 11:08:55 AM CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDES AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION More than 60 different cyanogenic glucosides (forming glucosides with -D-glucose) are widely distributed among plants (more than 2 600 cyanogenic taxa have been reported) especially among members of the families Rosaceae, Fabaceae, Poaeae and Araceae. In case of emergency, i.e. when plants are wounded by herbivores or other organisms, the cellular compartmen- tation breaks down and vacuolar cyanogenic glucosides come into contact with an active -glucosidase of broad specificity, which hydrolyses them to yield 2-hydroxynitrile (cyanohydrine). 2-Hydroxynitrile is further cleaved into the corresponding aldehyde or ketone and hydroprussic acid (HCN) by a hydroxynitrile lyase. Foods that contain cyanogens, such as manihot (Manihot esculenta) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), have repeatedly caused intoxication and even death in people and animals. Special care must be taken when such food is prepared; traditionally cyanogens and hydrocyanide are leached out during food processing. In recent years plant breeders have produced varieties in which the pathways leading to cyanogenic glucosides have been down-regulated. Hydrocyanide (HCN) is highly toxic to animals or microorganisms due to its inhibition of enzymes of the respiratory chain (i.e. cytochrome oxidase) because it blocks the essential ATP production. HCN also binds to other enzymes containing heavy metal ions. -glucosidase hydroxynitrile lyase (S)-Prunasin Benzaldehyde (R)-Sambunigrin (R=H) Linamarin (R)-Dhurrin (R=OH) S-Prunasin is commonly found in the seeds (sometimes also the leaves) of cherries, plums, apples, apricots and almonds (genus Prunus, Rosaceae). R-Sambunigrin (R=H) occurs in Sambucus species (Adoxaceae); R-Dhurrin (R=OH) in Sorghum species. Linamarin occurs in linseeds (Linum usitatissimum; Linaceae). 418 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 418 6/5/2017 11:08:56 AM GLUCOSINOLATES AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION More than 80 different glucosinolates have been found in higher dicotyledonous plants in the order of Capparales, which includes the phylogenetically related families Capparidaceae, Brassicaceae, Resedaceae, Moringaceae, Tropaeolaceae and others. Glucosinolates are polar molecules, which are formed in the cytoplasm and stored in vacuoles. All plant parts may accumulate glucosinolates, but seeds and roots are often especially rich in these allelochemicals. Concentrations are in the range of 0.1–0.2% fresh weight in leaves, up to 0.8% in roots and up to 8% in seeds. When plants are wounded, the resulting tissue decompartmentation brings myrosinase in contact with the glucosinolates. When hydrolysed, glucosinolates liberate D-glucose, sulfate and an unstable aglycone, which may convert at pH 5–8 to isothiocyanate (common name “mustard oil”) as the main product. Isothiocyanates are responsible for the distinctive, pungent flavour and odour of mustards and horseradish. Alkyl-, alkenyl-, methylthioalkyl- and benzylisothiocyanates are lipophilic, volatile allelochemicals that can disturb the fluidity of biomembranes and can covalently bind to free amino groups of enzymes, receptors or other mac- romolecules. Because isothiocyanates can easily penetrate biomembranes, they can interact with epidermal and mucosal tissues. At higher concentrations painful irritations, bronchitis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, heart and kidney disorders and even abortions can be the result. Isothiocyanates are antibiotic, because besides making bacterial or fungal cells leaky, interactions with proteins and cellular targets are likely. S – Gluc Sinigrin Allyl isothiocyanate S – Gluc Glucotropaeolin Benzyl isothiocyanate Sinigrin occurs in Brassica nigra (Brassicaceae) and Armoracia rusticana (Brassicaceae) and produces allyl isothio- cyanate. Glucotropaeolin is the main GS in Tropaeolum majus (Tropaeolaceae) and yields benzyl isothiocyanate. 419 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 419 6/5/2017 11:08:56 AM TERPENOIDS AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION Terpenoids represent a large class of plant products. Main groups include monoterpenes (with 10 carbon atoms), sesquiterpenes (15 carbon atoms), diterpenes (20 carbon atoms), triterpenes (30 carbon atoms), steroids (27 carbon atoms or less), tetraterpenes (40 carbon atoms) and polyterpenes. Although their main building blocks are simple, most terpenes represent complex structures because of various chemical groups and secondary ring formations. Iridoids A subclass of monoterpenes are the iridoid glucosides (secoiridoids, secologanin derivatives) with more than 200 structures distributed in the families Apocynaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Gentianaceae, Lamiaceae, Loganiaceae, Menyanthaceae, Plantaginaceae, Rubiaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Verbenaceae. glucose glucose glucose Aucubin Harpagide Harpagoside glucose Gentiopicrin Valepotriate Aucubin occurs in Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), Veronica officinalis (Plantaginaceae), Euphrasia officinalis (Orobanchaceae) and Ajuga reptans (Lamiaceae). These drugs are used against infections and inflammations. Harpagoside and harpagide have been found in Harpagophytum procumbens (Pedaliaceae); harpagide also in Scrophu- laria nodosa (Scrophulariaceae). These iridoids or their metabolites have analgesic and antirheumatic properties. Iridoid glucosides are cleaved in the animal body to the corresponding aglycons. The lactol ring may open now, generating reactive aldehyde functions that can form covalent bonds with amino groups of proteins. This mechanism could explain anti-inflammatory properties of iridoid drugs; the alkylation could lead to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase and can thus interfere with the production of inflammation promotors, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Some iridoids, such as the gentiopicrosides (e.g. gentiopicrin), present in Gentianaceae and Menyanthaceae, have an extremely bitter taste and are used as bitter tonics in phytomedicine to induce the secretion of diges- tive enzymes (“amara”). Valepotriates from Valeriana officinalis (Caprifoliaceae) have sedative properties; they stimulate the GABA receptor. Because of their epoxide group they are reactive and can cause mutations under experimental conditions. Volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes Mono- and sesquiterpenes are often volatile and can be isolated through steam distillation as “essential oils”. These compounds are usually lipophilic and are stored in specialised oil cells, trichomes, resin channels or other dead cells. They are especially abundant in Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, Rutaceae, Lauraceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Myrtaceae and Zingiberaceae. 420 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 420 6/5/2017 11:08:56 AM Monoterpenes occur as linear molecules or with 1 or 2 ring structures.

A well-known representative is helenalin of Arnica species. Its exocyclic methylene group easily binds to SH-groups of proteins. This explains the broad pharmacologi- cal activities of Arnica, such as anti-inflammatory drugs. The sesquiterpene artemisinin from Artemisia annua with a reactive peroxide function has recently been developed into a potent antimalaria drug, since it is active against Plasmodium falciparum. Some sesquiterpenes are highly reactive compounds, such as ptaquiloside in the bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum). Bracken is known to cause bladder cancer in humans and livestock. Diterpenes Diterpenes occur in several gymnosperms, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Thymelaeaceae, Lamiaceae and others. Among them we find extremely complex ring structures. TPA (phorbol ester) Forskolin A number of diterpenes are infamous for their toxic properties, such as phorbol esters of Euphorbiaceae and hymelaeaceae; they mimic the endogenous signal molecule diacylglycerol and thus activate protein kinase C and can act as tumour promoters. Ingenol mebutate is currently used against actinic keratoses to prevent skin cancer. Forskolin from Coleus forskohlii (=Plectranthus barbatus, Lamiaceae) is an activator of adenynyl cyclase and leads to the production of the second messenger cAMP. Another diterpene is paclitaxel (TaxolTM) from the yew (Taxaceae) that can be isolated from several yew species (including the North American Taxus brevifolia and the European Taxus baccata). See page 346 for further discussion. Biological activities of terpenoids Terpenes (mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpenes) have a number of common activities that can be discussed to- gether. They are usually highly hydrophobic substances. Most of them readily interact with biomembranes. They can increase the fluidity of the membranes, which can lead to uncontrolled efflux of ions and metabolites, and receptors, or even to cell leakage resulting in cell death. A conformation change of membrane proteins (e.g. ion channels, transporters) can occur when the lipophilic compounds dive into the biomembrane and gather close to membrane proteins. If Na+, K+ or Ca++-channels are affected, a disturbance of signal transduction could result. The use of essential oils to treat spasms and light pain in case of dyspeptic or gall disorders could thus be plausibly explained. Since the lipophilic terpenes can cross the blood-brain barrier, we can also explain the sedative and analeptic effects ascribed to several drugs. This membrane activity is rather unspecific; therefore, terpenes show antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against a wide range of organisms, ranging from bacteria, fungi, to insects and vertebrates. The antimicrobial properties explain the wide distribution and utilisation of plants with essential oils as mild antibacterial drugs used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections and disorders of the respiratory tract. 422 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 422 6/5/2017 11:08:58 AM Important functional groups of terpenes are the aldehyde function that forms covalent bonds with free amino groups of proteins (Schiff’s bases), and also terminal or exocyclic methylene groups, that couple to SH groups of proteins. Inner oxides or peroxides of terpenes are chemically reactive and can bind to proteins. When proteins are so alkylated, their spatial structure and thus the bioactivity can change. The use of essential oils as counter-irritant or as diuretic can be inferred from the membrane disturbances caused on the skin or in the kidneys. This can be both a membrane or a membrane protein interaction. Essential oils stimulate fluid excretion in the lungs and also activate cilial activity in bronchia. This is the basis on which plants containing these substances are used as secretolytic and secretomotoric drugs. Considering the known biological properties of terpenoids, the side-effects of essential oils (abortifacient, al- lergenic, narcotic, nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic properties) can be explained plausibly, especially if the drugs were consumed in larger doses. Triterpenes, steroids and saponins Triterpenes and steroids (biogenetically derived from C-30 precursors) can occur as free compounds but more often as saponins (with one to several sugar molecules attached to them). Whereas free triterpenes and steroids are lipophilic compounds, the glycosidic saponins are water-soluble and are stored in the vacuole. Saponins are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and approximately 70% of all plants produce them. Steroidal saponins are abundant in monocots of the families Dioscoreaceae, Trilliaceae, Liliaceae, Agavaceae, Asparagaceae, Convallariaceae, Amaryllidaceae and Smilacaceae. Triterpene saponins mainly occur in angiosperm families such as the Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Ranunculaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Theaceae, Fabaceae, Apiaceae, Araliaceae, Primulaceae and Sapotaceae. Gymnosperms are apparently without saponins. Saponins are mainly stored as inactive furostanol glycosides or triterpene bidesmosides in the vacuole (the active compounds would destroy the tonoplast of the producing plants!). When attacked by microbes or herbivores these compounds are converted into spirostanol glycosides or triterpene monodesmosides that exhibit membrane activity. wounding -glucosidase Sarsaparilloside Sarsapogenin sugars Above is an example of a steroid saponin (sarsaparilloside) that is converted to the monodesmosidic spirostanol (sarsapogenin). 423 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 423 6/5/2017 11:08:58 AM wounding esterase Hederasaponin C rha/ara – O -Hederin The above example shows a bidesmosidic triterpene saponin (hederasaponin C) that is converted into its monodes- mosidic counterpart (-hederin). Quassin Cucurbitacin B Quassin, a modified triterpene from Quassia jamaicensis (Simaroubaceae), is an especially bitter tasting compound and is used as a bitter, but also as an anthelmintic and insecticide. Cucurbitacins from Bryonia and other Cucur- bitaceae are equally bitter, but exhibit strong laxative properties as well. Monodesmosidic saponins are amphiphilic compounds (i.e. they have a hydrophilic sugar and a lipophilic terpene moiety), which can complex cholesterol in biomembranes with their lipophilic terpenoid moiety and bind to surface glycoproteins and glycolipids with their sugar side chain. This leads to a severe tension of the biomembrane and leakage. This activity can easily be demonstrated with erythrocytes that lose their haemoglobin through haemolysis when in contact with saponins. This membrane activity is not limited to erythrocytes, but affects animal cells as well as fungal or, to a lesser extent, bacterial cells. Also, cardiac glycosides and steroidal alkaloids from Solanum species react as saponins at higher doses. The antimicrobial effect partly explains the wide use of saponin drugs in phytotherapy to overcome mainly external infections. Because of general toxicity, an internal use refers to low doses. For example, saponins affect the nervus vagus in the stomach and reflectorily induce a secretion of water in the lungs thus leading to secretolytic effects. Therefore, plants containing saponins are widely used as secretolytic drugs. Higher doses cause an emetic effect or toxicity. Steroids, triterpenes and saponins of plant drugs sometimes structurally resemble endogenous hormones, e.g. glucocorticoids. The anti-inflammatory effects reported from many drugs could be due to a corticomimetic effect. The triterpenes or steroids could directly interfere with phospholipase A (a direct target for anti-inflammatory 2 secondary metabolites) or indirectly activate nuclear receptors which control the formation of inflammation mediators and of phospholipase A. 2 424 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 424 6/5/2017 11:08:59 AM Glycyrrhizic acid A pronounced anti-inflammatory activity has been reported for glycyrrhizic acid from Glycyrrhiza glabra (Fabaceae), a triterpene saponin with a sweet taste. Since the metabolism of potassium can be interrupted by glycyrrhizic acid, liquorice should not be consumed in large quantities and over long periods. Cardiac glycosides A special case of steroidal saponins are cardiac glycosides that inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase and are therefore strong toxins but useful in medicine (doses 1–3 mg/d) to treat heart problems. Heart glycosides have a specific effect on the dynamics and rhythm of the heart. From a pharmacological point of view the various structures are very similar. They are positively inotropic, negatively dromotropic and chronotropic as well as positively bathmotropic. Quantitatively, there are differences in the absorption rate, latency, duration of action and the risk of cumulation. Cardiac glycosides can be divided in two classes: Cardenolides have been found in Plantaginaceae (Digitalis), Apocynaceae (Apocynum, Nerium, Strophanthus, Thevetia, Periploca, Xysmalobium), Brassicaceae (Erysimum, Cheir- anthus), Celastraceae (Euonymus), Asparagaceae (Convallaria) and Ranunculaceae (Adonis). Bufadienolides occur in Crassulaceae (Kalanchoe), Asparagaceae (Drimia) and Ranunculaceae (Helleborus). The varying structures hardly influence the binding of cardiac glycosides at Na+/K+-ATPase; however their absorption differs. Polar molecules are absorbed very slowly, but once inside the body their action is rapid. Lipophilic cardiac glycosides easily diffuse into the body, but because of their binding to plasma proteins they remain in the system for prolonged periods of time. sugars sugars Ouabain Digitoxin Scillaren Ouabain is a polar cardiac glycoside from Strophanthus gratus (Apocynaceae), which is applied intravenously; it has been widely used as an arrow poison in Africa. Digitoxin and related substances are isolated from Digitalis lanata (Plantaginaceae) and are administered orally. Scillaren is a bufadienolide from Drimia maritima (Asparagaceae). Tetraterpenes Carotenoids represent the most important members of tetraterpenes with antioxidant properties. An example is -carotene (from carrots, Daucus carota). They are highly lipophilic compounds and are always associated 425 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 425 6/5/2017 11:08:59 AM with biomembranes. In chloroplasts they serve as accessory pigments important for photosynthesis. They also protect against UV light. Some flowers and many fruits are rich in carotenoids: in these instances they help to attract pollinating insects and, more importantly, seed-dispersing animals. Whereas young and immature fruits are usually green (containing toxic secondary metabolites in addition; e.g. steroid alkaloids in tomatoes or in Solanum dulcamara), ripe fruit (without noxious secondary metabolites) advertise their physiological state with prominent red colours (that can be detected by birds and mammals). The red and orange colours are due to carotenoids. Carotenoids are the precursors for vitamin A in animals, which is used to produce retinal (a light sensor in the rhodopsin complex) and retinoic acid (retinoids bind to nuclear receptors and are local mediators of vertebrate development and the working of the immune system). They also exhibit antioxidant activities. -Carotene Polyterpenes Polyterpenes, consisting of 10 to 1 000 isoprene units, are prominent in latex of Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, Apocynaceae, Sapotaceae and Asteraceae. Some polyterpenes are used commercially such as rubber (from Hevea brasiliensis, Euphorbiaceae) or gutta-percha (from Palaquium, Sapotaceae). PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS: PHENYLPROPANOIDS, COUMARINS, FLAVONOIDS AND TANNINS AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION Phenylpropanoids derive from phenylalanine and tyrosine via desamination and represent building blocks for a wide variety of phenolic compounds. Phenylpropanoids can occur as simple compounds (as phenylacrylic acids, phenylacrylic aldehydes, or phenylallyl alcohols) that differ by their degree of hydroxylation and methoxylation. Cinnamic acid p-Coumaric acid Caffeic acid Sinapic acid Examples of simple phenylpropanoids gluc Syringic acid Gallic acid Salicylic acid Salicin Examples of phenolic acids A shortening of the side chain leads to benzoic acid and corresponding derivatives, such as syringic acid and gallic acid. Especially important in the medicinal context are salicylic acid, saligenin and the respective glucoside, salicin. Salicylic acid and derivatives are useful in medicine because they inhibit a key enzyme of prostaglandin biosyn- 426 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 426 6/5/2017 11:09:01 AM thesis, i.e. cyclooxygenase. These compounds are known from willows (Salix species, Salicaceae), poplars (Populus species, also Salicaceae), Filipendula ulmaria (Rosaceae), Primula veris (Primulaceae) and Viola tricolor (Violaceae). Rosmarinic acid Phenylpropanoids can also be conjugated with a second phenylpropanoid, such as in rosmarinic acid (because of the number of phenolic hydroxyl groups this compound has been regarded as a tannin typical of Lamiaceae) or with amines, such as coumaroylputrescine. Umbelliferone Psoralen Angelicin Examples of coumarins and furocoumarins Phenylpropanoids serve as building blocks for coumarins and furocoumarins. Simple coumarins are stored as coumaroylglucosides in the vacuole. Upon tissue damage these glucosides are hydrolysed by a -glucosidase. After isomerisation and formation of a lactone ring, simple coumarins are generated, such as umbelliferone. Coumarins can reach concentrations of up to 2% in plants and are common in the Apiaceae (most genera), and in certain Fabaceae (e.g. Dipteryx odorata, Melilotus officinalis), Poaceae (e.g. Anthoxanthum odoratum), Rubiaceae (e.g. Ga- lium odoratum). Furocoumarins usually have a third furane ring that derives from active isoprene. A linear type (psoralen-type) or angular type (angelicin-type) are distinguished. The furocoumarins are present in aerial parts such as leaves and fruits but also in roots and rhizomes. They are abundant in Apiaceae (contents up to 4%), but also present in certain genera of the Fabaceae (e.g. Psoralea bituminosa) and Rutaceae. Furocoumarins can intercalate DNA and upon illumination with UV light can form cross-links with DNA bases, but also with proteins. They are therefore mutagenic and possibly carcinogenic. In plants they serve as defence compounds against herbivores and pathogens. In medicine, furocoumarins are employed in the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo. Phenylpropanoids can form complex dimeric structures, so-called lignans. Podophyllotoxin, which occurs in members of the genera Podophyllum (Berberidaceae), Linum (Linaceae), and Anthriscus (Apiaceae) is a potent inhibitor of microtubule formation and thus prevents cell division. Podophyllotoxin and its derivatives have been used in cancer therapy. Condensation of phenylpropanoids forms the complex lignin macromolecules that are important for the mechanical stability of plants, but also show some antimicrobial and antioxidant effects. Podophyllotixin 427 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 427 6/5/2017 11:09:03 AM Stilbenes Chalcones Isoflavones Resveratrol Isoliquiritigenin Genistein Flavones Flavonols Flavanones Apigenin Kaempferol Naringenin Phenylpropanoids can condense with a polyketide moiety to form flavonoids, chalcones, catechins and anthocyanins. These compounds are characterised by two aromatic rings that carry several phenolic hydroxy or methoxylgroups. In addition, they often occur as glycosides and are stored in vacuoles. Anthocyanidin Peonidin The colour of anthocyanins depends on the degree of glycosylation, hydrogen ion concentration and the presence of certain metals (e.g. aluminum ions) in the vacuole. Parallel to a change in pH of the vacuole in developing flowers, a colour change from pink to dark blue can be observed in several species of the Boraginaceae (e.g. Symphytum, Echium). Many of the flavonoids, chalcones and anthocyanins are widely distributed in higher plants and show colours under visual and UV light and are typical secondary metabolites of flowers and fruits. They function to attract pollinating insects or fruit-dispersing animals. The phenolic hydroxyl groups of flavonoids can interact with proteins to form hydrogen, ionic bonds and thus modulate a multitude of molecular targets. They can be regarded as general protein modifying compounds. Since proteins are involved in most disorders and disturbances, these properties can explain the utility of phenolics in medicine. In consequence, they are apparently the active ingredients in many phytomedicines. Isoflavones are common secondary metabolites in legumes (subfamily Papilionoideae). They exhibit oestrogenic activities and inhibit tyrosine kinases. Because of these properties they are often regarded as useful compounds that might play a role in the prevention of certain cancers (breast cancer, prostate cancer) and the regulation of hormonal disturbances. 428 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 428 6/5/2017 11:09:06 AM Epicatechin Catechin Procyanidin B4 Catechins form a special class of flavonoids, which often dimerise or even polymerise to form procyanidins and oligomeric procyanidins. The conjugates (which cannot be hydrolysed; “non-hydrolysable tannins”) are characterised by a large number of hydroxyl groups. The phenolic hydroxyl groups can interact with proteins to form hydrogen and ionic bonds and possibly even covalent bonds. If more than 20 hydroxyl groups are present these compounds act as “tannins”. These compounds have antimicrobial activities and can inhibit receptors and enzymes – exter- nally, internally and in the digestive tract. The protein interactions are the basis for the utilisation of plants with catechins in phytotherapy (e.g. Crataegus monogyna in patients with heart problems). Pentagalloyl glucose Another important group of tannins is hydrolysable (so-called hydrolysable tannins). They represent esters between gallic acid and sugars; in addition several moieties of gallic acid can be present that are also linked by ester bonds. These gallotannins (an example, pentagalloyl glucose, is shown above) are widely distributed in plants, often in bark, leaves and fruits. Especially rich in gallotannins are galls induced by various gall-forming insects. Gallotan- nins, which can additionally be condensed with catechins, contain a large number of phenolic hydroxyl groups so that they can form stable protein-tannin complexes and thus interact with a wide variety of protein targets in microbes and animals (see also catechins; paragraph above). Tannins are useful in medicine to treat dermal and mucosal infections and disturbances; intestinal problems (such as diarrhoea) have traditionally been treated with tannin-rich phytomedicines. In summary, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids (including coumarins, furocoumarins, tannins, etc.) exhibit a wide range of biological activities. In several instances, they act as analogues of cellular signal compounds or substrates. Afflicted targets range from prostaglandin and leukotriene formation, enzyme inhibition, oestrogenic properties (coumarins, isoflavones, stilbenes) to DNA alkylation (e.g. by furocoumarins). These molecules usually have several phenolic hydroxyl groups in common, which can form hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds (maybe also covalent bonds) with proteins and peptides. These interactions disturb secondary and tertiary protein structures. The higher the number of phenolic hydroxyl groups, the stronger the astringent and denaturing effect. Tannins form stable protein-tannin complexes and inhibit enzymatic activities very effectively. 429 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 429 6/5/2017 11:09:07 AM POLYkETIDES AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION Polyketides derive from acetate as a building block and either represent secondary metabolites in their own right (such as anthraquinones), or they form mixed compounds (such as flavonoids). Secondary metabolites with an anthracene skeleton can be present as anthrones, anthraquinones, anthranols, dianthrones, naphthodianthrones and dianthranoles. In plants, anthracene compounds are usually present as mono- or diglycosides. Anthracene derivatives are common in certain genera of the Polygonaceae, Rhamnaceae, Fabaceae (Caesalpinioideae), Ru- biaceae, Hypericaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae. An anthrone An anthronol An anthraquinone (Emodine) Glycosylated monomeric anthrones exhibit a strong laxative activity by interfering with intestinal Na+/K+-ATPase and adenylyl cyclase. Water content of faeces is increased and gut motility stimulated. They had been used in medicine for several thousand years as laxatives. Anthraquinones also have phenolic OH-groups and can therefore interact with many proteins in the human body. These compounds can also interact with DNA and can probably cause mutations. Glucose Plumbagin Arbutin Hypericin Dimeric anthraquinones (such as hypericin) are also present in Hypericum perforatum (Hypericaceae) and contribute to its pharmacology. The naphthoquinone plumbagin is present in Drosera species (Droseraceae) and appears to be responsible for the antitussive effects. Arbutin, a simple quinone, is present in many species of the Ericaceae; the free quinone appears to be responsible for the antibacterial effects. 430 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 430 6/5/2017 11:09:08 AM POLYACETYLENES, THIOPHENES, ALkAMIDES, FATTY ACIDS AND WAxES AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION Polyacetylenes or polyines are aliphatic hydrocarbons with carbon-carbon (C-C) triple and double bonds, such as in falcarinol. Falcarinol Polyines are common in Asteraceae, Campanulaceae, Apiaceae, Araliaceae, Oleaceae and Santalaceae. Polyines are reactive molecules that can interfere with membrane proteins (receptors, ion channels, transporters) and other proteins. They are active against bacteria, fungi, insects and nematodes. 5-(3-Buten-1-ynyl)-2,2 ′-bithienyl (BBT) -Tertienyl In some plants, we find derivatives of polyines in which oxygen or sulphur have been added to the triple bonds and secondary ring formations have occurred. Typical examples are thiophenes from Tagetes (Asteraceae) that exhibit a wide range of antimicrobial activities. Two examples are shown above. Deca-2E,4E-dienoic acid isobutylamide Alkamides (150 structures have been reported) can be regarded as polyenes with nitrogen-containing substituents. They occur in Piperaceae, Aristolochiaceae, Rutaceae and Asteraceae and appear to be antimicrobial, insecticidal and molluscicidal. Most fatty acids can be regarded as primary metabolites. Some have altered side chains and exhibit strong pharmacological effects, such as the purgative ricinoleic acid from Ricinus communis. 431 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 431 6/5/2017 11:09:08 AM CARBOHYDRATES AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION Plants produce and store several carbohydrates and organic acids, most of which must be regarded as primary me- tabolites. Several carbohydrates, such as glucose, galactose or mannose, are used to form glycosides with secondary metabolites and are thus participants of both primary and secondary metabolism. Arabinose Digitalose Galactose Mannose Examples of simple carbohydrates A special example is phytic acid (a myoinositol esterified with up to six phosphate groups) that can complex Ca++ and Mg++ ions and thus functions as antinutritive substance. Stachyose Several di-, tri- and oligosaccharides, such as stachyose and raffinose (which are typical for seeds and roots) produce substantial flatulence in humans. Hexoses and pentoses are also the building blocks of important polysaccharides in plants, such as starch, cel- lulose, hemicellulose and pectin. In addition, a number of plants produce mucilage and specific storage products, such as inulin in Asteraceae and Campanulaceae. Plants rich in mucilage are used in medicine to treat coughs, to improve digestion and topically to soothe inflamed skin. The mucilage can form a protective film over inflamed mucosal tissues. 432 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 432 6/5/2017 11:09:09 AM QUICk GUIDE TO COMMERCIALISED MEDICINAL PLANTS Engraved title page, with representations of Theophrastus and Dioscorides, from The herball or, generall historie of plantes by John Gerard 433 Medicinal Plants of the World (English).indb 433 6/5/2017 11:09:10 AM Origin: A=Africa, SA=Southern Africa, NA=North Africa, WA=West Africa; Eu=Europe; NAm=North America, CAm=Central America, SAm=South America; As=Asia, EAs=East Asia; Aus=Australia.
