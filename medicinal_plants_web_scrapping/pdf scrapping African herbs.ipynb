The second edition is designed to present most of the old\\ninformation plus new information on the more important of those original 365 herbs. I submitted\\nthe first edition under the original unpublished title, Herbs of Dubious Salubrity. I intentionally left\\nout many of the completely safe culinary herbs, spices, and food plants that are clearly medicinal.\\nI also intentionally omitted some strictly dangerous herbs, such as foxglove, that were too unhealthy\\nfor use in unskilled hands. I did include several obscure hallucinogenic plants of dubious salubrity.\\nI did, or should have, dropped some of these because they have little medicinal importance. Some\\npoorly documented species, such as Mimosa hostilis and Phoradendron leucarpum, for example,\\nwere retained with fragmentary entries, so as to at least mention species from the first edition that\\nmight better have been dropped.\\nNow I think I have the most important herbs well covered here. In edition two, which I will\\nrefer to frequently as my Herbal Desk Reference (HDR), I have tried to concisely corral the data\\non some 1000 herbs in as little space as possible, striving to make a reliable, referenced resource\\nto parallel the PDR for Herbal Medicines. I use the three-letter abbreviation, HDR, to indicate the\\nsecond edition of my Handbook of Medicinal Herbs, because I compare and contrast it to other\\nimportant sources, which are also represented by three-letter abbreviations. (See the reference\\nabbreviation appendix.)\\nWith this edition, I have tried to cover most of the widely mentioned medicinal plants, whether\\nthey are extremely salubrious or extremely toxic. Without counting them, I estimate we include\\nmore than 1000 of the most important herbs, including the more important herbs from the young\\nNative American and the European traditions (including most of those approved by Commission\\nE (KOM), and almost all of those included in the PDR for Herbal Medicine (PHR for the first\\nedition, and PH2 for the second edition). Unlike Commission E and the Herbal PDR, which seem\\nto stress European and American traditions, I include proportionately more herbs from the older\\nAfrican, Ayurvedic, and Chinese traditions as well, not wanting to slight any major medicinal plant\\nfrom any major tradition.\\nLet me explain the new format for the second edition. First, a common name appears, usually\\nbut not always in English, followed by a recently accepted scientific name, with the authority for\\nthe scientific name. Then follows a safety score, X, +, ++, or +++. An X means I don’t recommend\\ntaking it at all, or realize that it is so dangerous that it should not be taken without expert guidance.\\nBut for litigious reasons, I give some potent medicinal herbs the X (amateurs beware!). A single\\nplus (+) indicates that I do not consider that the herb is, overall, as safe as coffee. I score two\\npluses (++) for those herbs I think of, overall, as being as safe as coffee. I score three pluses (+++)\\nfor those herbs I believe to be safer than coffee. In the first edition, I related the plus sign to a cup\\nof coffee, figuring that 1, 2, or 3 cups per day of an herbal tea from the herb would be as safe as\\n1, 2, or 3 cups per day of coffee. I often drink more than 3 cups of coffee a day, especially while\\nI worked on this project! Clearly, this is an oversimplification. Too often, some parts of a plant are\\nmore helpful or more toxic than other parts of the same species, and different ethnic groups or\\ncultures may use parts differently. The safety scoring is a continuation of the same scoring system\\nI used in the first edition. Some scores have been upgraded a bit, some have been downgraded.\\nOften, there are some comments on synonymy and other nomenclature difficulties that arose\\nin completing this opus. I inject these following the nomenclature line. Here you may find some\\nproven and/or suspected synonyms, or notes of related species that may be included in this species\\nconcept, especially by nontaxonomically trained authors. I have often used, as final arbiter of\\nscientific names and sometimes common names, the nomenclature database at the USDA (www.ars-\\ngrin.gov; curator, Dr. John. H. Wiersema: sbmljw@ars-grin.gov).\\nUnfortunately, the new American Herbal Products Association (AHP) book on nomenclature\\narrived too late for our consideration. Attempts to standardize common names, although admirable,\\nare often aggravating to special interests. It was with some misgiving that I arranged this book\\nalphabetically by common names, when the first edition was by scientific name. It generated big\\nheadaches for all of us who think more along the lines of scientific names. Would it be under\\nmulberry or black mulberry, chamomile or German chamomile? Some plants have dozens of\\ncommon names. Several have suffered almost as many scientific names, such as, for example,\\nfeverfew. Hopefully, you will find it easy to use.\\nIn the Activities and Indications sections, parenthetical numbers are followed by three-letter\\nabbreviations (abbreviation of source) or an alphanumeric X-1111111 to identify PubMed citations.\\nA parenthetical efficacy score of (1) means that a chemical in the plant or in an extract of the plant\\nhas shown the activity or proven out experimentally (animal, not clinical) for the indication. This\\ncould be in vitro animal or assay experiments. A hint: not real human proof! Nothing clinical yet!\\nI give it a score of (2) if the aqueous extract, ethanolic extract, or decoction or tea derived from\\nthe plant has been shown to have the activity, or to support the indication in clinical trials.\\nCommission E (KOM) and Tramil Commission (TRA) approvals were automatically given a score\\nof (2) also, because they represented consensus opinions of distinguished panels. The rare score\\nof (3) for efficacy means that clinical trials exist to show that the plant itself (not just an extract\\nor phytochemical derivative) has the indications or activities. The solitary score of (f) in many of\\nthe citations means it is unsupported folk medicine, or I have not seen the science to back it up.\\nThe three-letter abbreviations are useful short citations of the references consulted in arriving at\\nthese numbers. I have by no means cited every source. However, unlike KOM and hopefully better\\nthan PHR, we indicate at least one source for every indication and activity we report.\\nThus, we have a score for Safety and a score for Efficacy, the latter backed up by the three-\\nletter abbreviations or citations, often PubMed citations. In addition to our three letter abbreviations\\nfor the frequently consulted texts, we occasionally cite articles cited from the PubMed database\\nwith their unique abstract number, preceded by the letter X. For example, I received a paper showing\\nthat ginger contained several COX-2 inhibitors. I looked in the PubMed database to find the unique\\nabstract citation number, PMID: 11437391, which I shortened for database purpose to X11437391.\\nSo, all alpha-numeric (X-numerical) combinations will refer you to the source in the PubMed\\ndatabase. Whenever I update one of my Herb-a-Day columns, I automatically search PubMed for\\n>species name AND 2000 <, which automatically gives me the post 1999 abstracts. In 2001, I\\nsearch for >species AND 2001<. Then I order hard copies of those articles that look promising for\\ndatabase purposes.\\nOften, many more than 10 sources were involved in my decision-making. In many instances,\\nI limited citations to three, typically the ones that were most important at arriving at my scores.\\nNot wanting to blow my own horn, my own books were first to be deleted from the list when it\\nexceeded three. In preparing this edition I realized that for patent litigation, the earlier citations\\nwere most valuable, so at the last minute I added several older references, such as DEP, FEL, HHB,\\nand MAD. For example, even I was surprised when I read about Remifemin in HHB (1973, p. 12),\\nthree decades ago, since Remifemin seems so new here in America. But in my mind it is just\\nanother native American remedy, coming back home to us, slightly upgraded, after having been\\nbetter studied in Europe than it has been in America (other examples include evening primrose,\\npassionflower, and saw palmetto). DEP and FEL citations are more than 100 years old, and might\\nbe useful in challenging frivolous patents.\\nOne very important abbreviation, WAM, might as well be viewed as MOM, meaning pediatric.\\nThis comes from the excellent book, Kids, Herbs, Health, by Dr. Linda White, MD, and Sunny\\nMavor. So, if you are looking for an herb that has been suggested by a pediatrician, scroll down\\nto WAM. Ditto for PIP, Hans Schilcher’s Phytotherapy in Paediatrics.\\nThis is an evolving system that changes as new science validates the folklore, often resulting\\nin an upgrading of the indication or activity. Occasionally, bad news about the plant will result in\\nmy lowering its safety rating, from +++ to ++, or ++ to +, or + to X. This does not constitute my\\nrecommendation of an herb. It merely indicates how I think the herb compares with others, based\\non the literature surveyed. As a botanist, I cannot legally, and do not, prescribe. But I find mechanical\\nsearches of the Handbook of Medicinal Herbs to be an extremely fast way to find the better herbs\\nfor a given indication.\\nWe have used the same abbreviations that are used in my database at the USDA (http://www.ars-\\ngrin.gov/duke). I much prefer the abbreviations used there because they do not get you into as\\nmuch trouble when you e-mail a query to the taxpaying public. For example, the preferred abbre-\\nviation of microgram, at least with some publishers (including CRC), but not me, is µg. Too often,\\nif I put that abbreviation (or use an italicized u) in an e-mail, the u or µ disappears and the reader\\nreceives g instead of ug or µg, giving an often dangerously high reading, a million times too high.\\nDitto for ul or µl (microliter) as opposed to ml (milliliter). And with uM and mM, micromole and\\nmillimole, respectively.\\nIn a sense, my scored second edition is a loner’s approach to a Commission E, but I am the sole\\nmember of the fictitious commission, Commission U.S. for us, here in the good old USA. Note that\\nunlike the ratings in, for example, APA, my ratings assess the efficacy of each activity and indication.\\nI’ll keep revising the scoring for an online version as new information, positive or negative,\\ncomes in on the safety or efficacy of the herb, or chemicals it contains. So, like the allopaths, health\\nannouncers, and reporters, I reserve the right to change my mind as I oscillate from side to side\\nof the pendulum on my long, tedious, treacherous, and tumultuous trip, veering like a coiled\\ncaduceus, deviously toward the truth.\\nUsers will find it easy to search and find which herbs score highest for efficacy and safety. The\\nthree-letter abbreviations will lead them to some, but by no means all, of the sources I consulted\\nincluding the one(s) or some of them that led me to the numerical scores for efficacy. The scores\\nare my own. Only rarely did all the cited and consulted sources agree; but one of the indicated\\nsources provided the evidence that led me to arrive at the assigned score. By no means should\\nthese scores be attributed to anyone except me.\\nTHE APA RATINGS\\nA warning: my highest ratings are my best ratings. With the American Pharmaceutical Association\\n(APA) and the American Herbal Products Association (AHP), the converse is true: the higher the\\nnumber, the lower the rating. APA’s best, (1), is verified by large clinical, randomized, placebo-\\ncontrolled, double-blind, human trials. That too would have gotten approval, we assume, in Commis-\\nsion E. That would get a (2) in my HDR, if the study were of an extract of the plant, but a (3) for\\nexample if the study were of the natural whole herb, such as garlic or onion. The APA (1) and the\\nHDR (3) scores are rare indeed. Their number (1) means “Years of use and extensive, high-quality\\nstudies indicate that this substance is very effective and safe when used in recommended amounts\\nfor the indication(s) noted in the ‘Will It Work For You?’ section.” Unfortunately, they often mention\\nunapproved, unstudied folklore in this section, even clearly noting that it was unapproved. With APA,\\n(2) is a large, clinical human trial, but not necessarily double blind and placebo controlled. That would\\nalso get a (2) in my HDR, if the study were of an extract of the plant, but a (3) if the study were of\\nthe whole herb, rather than the extract. And the third one is hard for me to believe, but here is the\\nquote, “large, placebo-controlled animal experiment.” That would get a (1) in my HDR. The APA (4)\\nis for in vitro studies, which I suppose includes studies, e.g., of isolated phytochemicals. Those score\\n(1) in HDR. The APA (5) is for decades or centuries of well-known folk use, but no supporting studies.\\nThat would get an (f) for folkloric in the HDR. APA (6) is a large collection of case histories, which\\nwould also get an (f) in HDR. At the bottom of the APA ladder is the personal anecdote, which of\\ncourse, also gets an (f), even though it has not yet evolved into folklore.\\nTHE AHPA CLASSIFICATION\\nA few specific comments regarding the American Herbal Products Association (AHP). Although I\\nlike the way they handled some perplexing little details, such as idiosyncratic allergies, trivial\\nquantities of toxic substances, etc., I’m a little alarmed by their ‘Class 1’ definition. Why alarmed?\\nBecause I feel that all drugs, whether they be synthetic, phytochemical, nutritional, or herbal, “can\\nbe safely consumed when used appropriately.”\\nClass 1: Can be safely consumed if used appropriately.\\nClass 2: Herbs with the following use restrictions apply; unless otherwise directed by an\\nexpert qualified in the use of the substance:\\n(2a) External use only\\n(2b) Not for use in pregnancy\\n(2c) Not for use while nursing\\n(2d) Other restrictions as noted\\nClass 3: Herbs with significant data suggesting labeling: “To be used only under the super-\\nvision of an expert qualified in the appropriate use of this substance.” Labeling must\\ninclude proper use information: dosage, contraindications, potential adverse effects and\\ndrug interactions, and other information pertinent to the safe use of the substance.\\nClass 4: Herbs with data insufficient for classification.\\nWhy don’t I like that ‘Class 1’ definition? My interpretation of ‘Class 1’ definition is that\\nall herbs are ‘Class 1’ and can be safely used if used appropriately (appropriate is safe). Similarly,\\nI think we could say appropriately for many, if not most, herbs what AHPA says of labeling\\ninformation that should be required for aloe, “Do not use this product if you have abdominal\\npain or diarrhea. Consult a health care provider prior to use if you are pregnant or nursing.\\nDiscontinue use in the event of diarrhea or watery stools. Do not exceed recommended dose.\\nNot for long term use.” (AHP, 1997)\\nA subset of American phytomedicine advocates argue that we should emulate the German\\nCommission E’s Standard of Excellence. Which one? Two versions came out in 1998, purporting\\nto be authentic English presentations of the Commission E conclusions. There were some differ-\\nences; e.g., Blumenthal’s very careful book (identified as KOM in this book) states that hyssop is\\nunapproved by Commission E, while Gruenwald, in the second edition of the PDR for Herbal\\nMedicine, says hyssop is approved for colds, fevers, and gallbladder and liver complaints. In the\\ntitle line, where I evaluate safety, I scored hyssop with three pluses (+++), meaning that I think it\\nis safer than coffee as an herbal medicine. As to efficacy, I had decided to let Commission E\\nendorsement rank 2 in my Activities and Indications columns.\\nThis example of divergence between the published “Commission E” interpretations of\\nhyssop (and there are more than ten English interpretations of Commission E now) is just one\\nof many that I encountered as I traversed most of these interpretations. It really raises a serious\\nquestion again that I raised for myself back in the early 1980s as I was working on my Medicinal\\nPlants of China. Clearly, I was capable of working only with the English translations of Chinese\\nbooks on medicinal plants, embellished by three trips to China. I assumed that by the time I\\nhad compiled most of the information from five different books, there would be little new\\ninformation as I traversed the sixth. But diminishing returns had not yet set in. There are a few\\nmajor discrepancies in recent translations of romance language, scientific German, as with\\nCommission E. How many more can we expect in translations of ancient Chinese, Hindu, and\\nSanscrit writings that are thousands of years old? Small wonder we often encounter differences\\nof opinion.\\nOne can only be thankful that these books have survived because they document millennia\\nof empirical wisdom. The best of the herbal medicines have survived and the worst have been\\nmarginalized. That took thousands of years. You can almost say the same of pharmaceuticals:\\nsome have survived, while some of the worst have been marginalized or withdrawn. But none\\nof the pharmaceuticals have survived more than 200 years with us. But the ~140 herbs\\nmentioned in the Bible have been with us 2000 years. A recent study showed that humans\\nhave been active in the Biblical area for at least 1,700,000 years. So, the genes of some humans\\nhave experienced many of the phytochemicals from Biblical plants for nearly 2 million years.\\nMore new synthetics hit the market each year, to your peril, but few new herbs surface in a\\ngiven year. Mankind does not want bad medicine. Man empirically selects the good and rejects\\nthe bad. I feel strongly that many of the herbs treated in this book are as good as the competing\\nsynthetic pharmaceuticals, and almost always cost less, in dollars and in side effects. Until\\nthe better of these herbs have been clinically compared with the pharmaceuticals, neither your\\nphysician nor mine, nor you nor I, knows for sure which is best. Meanwhile, pharmaceuticals\\nwill kill more than 100,000 Americans a year, as per JAMA, a propharmaceutical journal, while\\nherbs will kill fewer than 100, as per the conservative Washington Post in an antiherb article\\n(Gugliotta, March 19, 2000). On May 1, 2002, the Journal of the American Medical Association\\n(JAMA) suggested that adverse drug reactions may be the leading cause of death in the United\\nStates.\\nFORMAT\\nSYNONYM: In some cases I list one or more taxonomic synonyms often following the USDA\\nNomenclature database, curated by John Wiersema http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/tax/taxgenform.html.\\nACTIVITIES: Most of the published biological activities that crossed my desk are listed\\nalphabetically, with each activity followed by the “f” or numerical score for efficacy, followed by\\nthe citation for the source.\\nINDICATIONS: Most published indications that crossed my desk are listed alphabetically,\\nwith each indication followed by the “f” or numerical score for efficacy, followed by the\\ncitation for the source. It was with some trepidation that I converted more specific terms such\\nas arthritis to arthrosis, and bronchitis to bronchosis, but I think that was a more economical\\n(space-wise) way of presenting the data. Classically, the suffix “itis” means inflammation, and\\n“osis” means ailment of. Thus, arthritis is inflammation of the joint, and arthrosis is broader,\\nmeaning an ailment in the joint. Where some author just said “for joint problems,” that became\\n“arthrosis,” but where they were more specific and said inflammation of the joint, it means\\nthe more specific “arthritis.” Toward the end we aggregated both under “arthrosis.” Many\\npeople will dislike that I converted all the more specific -itis entries to -osis, rather than\\nsomewhat redundantly include both.\\nDOSAGE: I have attempted in this edition to give the range of published dosage ranges I have\\nencountered. With good editorial prodding, I have gone back to my sources to see if they specified\\nwhich plant part. In some cases my sources were not specific as to plant part. And sometimes one\\nsource specified one part, another source identified another part. A few dosages were taken right\\noff the bottles of herbs. If there are dangerous published dosages given under dangerous herbs, I\\nhave indicated with an “X” that it should not be taken except with a skilled practitioner on hand.\\nNone of the dosages originate with me (except for an occasional “food farmacy” comment,\\nindicating that the herb is eaten as food); they are from the literature, as indicated by the usual set\\nof abbreviations. Several do, however, represent dosages said to have been approved by Commission\\nE, especially those cited with the abbreviations KOM, PHR, and PH2. I suppose by appearing in\\nan American Pharmaceutical Book, there is an indirect assumption that APA approves those APA\\ndata, but I am not sure they would give such approval.\\nCONTRAINDICATIONS, INTERACTIONS, AND SIDE EFFECTS: The scores of AHP,\\nPHR, and PH2 are cited followed by some of the reported perils of the herbs, indicated by the\\nusual three-letter or abstract citations giving the source of the warning regarding the “peril.”\\nEXTRACTS: More than 20 years ago, I started a phytochemical database that gives many\\nof the published activities of the bioactive phytochemicals. I regret at that time I had no systematic\\napproach to scoring the activities of the extracts of the plants. That is what we usually take,\\nrather than isolated phytochemicals. So, occasionally, too late, I have included some reports on\\nactivities (and ED50’s and LD50’s where available) on various extracts of the plants. We have\\nat the last minute deleted the repetition of the extensive data found in my updated FNF phy-\\ntochemical database, early versions of which were published in some of my previously published\\nCRC books.\\nDuke, J.A. Handbook of Phytochemical Constituents in GRAS Herbs and other Economic\\nPlants. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1992.\\nDuke, J.A. Handbook of Biologically Active Phytochemicals and Their Activities. CRC Press,\\nBoca Raton, FL, 1992.\\nBeckstrom-Sternberg, S. and Duke, J.A. Handbook of Mints (Aromathematics): Phytochem-\\nicals and Biological Activities. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1996.\\nWhere I found no significant information for any one format section, the headings were deleted,\\ntherefore, many entries will have only e.g., Activities and Indications.\\nReaders who wish to know more about the individual phytochemicals occurring in a given herb\\ncan find many useful queries answerable on my USDA database: www.ars-grin.gov/duke.\\nIn one particularly useful query for a person trying to rationalize the utility of an herb, one can\\nsecure a list of all the phytochemicals reported from the plant, with or without the list of all their\\nreported activities, even calling out a primary or secondary reference for each data bit. Printouts of\\nsuch queries on the better-studied plants are often dozens of pages long, and impractical to publish\\nin this edition. It becomes increasingly clear that there are hundreds of biologically active compounds,\\noften additive or synergistic, in all our plants, foods, spices, herbs; medicinal and poisonous plants\\nalike. The genes directing the thousands of chemicals in our own body have coevolved with all or\\nmany of the phytochemicals in most of the edible plants that our ancestors chose to eat and the\\nmedicinal plants with which they treated themselves. My genes have probably known thousands of\\nphytochemicals now extant in the Rift Valley (where anthropologists speculate that humans evolved\\nsome 6 million years ago), and still extant in my American herbs. I feel that homeostatic mechanisms\\nhave evolved for these long-known phytochemicals, enabling the body to grab a needed chemical in\\nwhich the body is temporarily deficient and, conversely, excluding perhaps as “expensive” urine, those\\nphytochemicals in which the body is not deficient. Yes, I even agree with “supplement-bashers,” who\\ncharge that excess vitamins are often excreted, unused, in the “expensive” urine. I am inclined to\\ndisagree if the basher suggests that most of us are not deficient in one vitamin or another. I think the\\nmajority of, if not all, Americans are deficient in one or more vitamins that occur in dietary plant\\nsources. Only within the last decade did we finally realize that choline was essential. I think more\\nsuch knowledge will surface in the decades ahead. And we will learn that such common and useful\\nphytochemicals as oleanolic acid, procyanidins, quercetin, resveratrol, and sitosterol are often needed\\nby the body and, like vitamins, kept within bounds by homeostatic mechanisms. When you offer your\\nbody an herbal menu of hundreds of useful synergistic phytochemicals, your body may select those\\nit needs most, rejecting the ones least needed or not needed at all. When you offer the body an isolated\\nphytochemical or synthetic pharmaceutical “silver bullet,” you are excluding all those hundreds of\\nother useful phytochemicals in the edible and medicinal herbs. Your body knows better than your\\npharmacist or physician or phytotherapist or shaman, which chemicals it needs. And your evolutionary\\ndiet will often provide chemicals in which you may be temporarily deficient. Your evolutionary diet\\nincluded a wide variety of plant materials that are no longer generally consumed. And your body, if\\nnot your brain, will recognize a positive benefit therefrom. The safer herbs will prevail, in spite of\\nmounting published efforts to make them seem more dangerous than the pharmaceuticals. Herbs, on\\naverage, are much cheaper and safer than pharmaceuticals, and often as efficacious.\\nILLUSTRATIONS: Mrs. Peggy Duke, my most vociferous critic, has generously rounded up\\nnearly 250 black-and-white illustrations and several color plates bearing her copyright. This is a\\nsubstantial improvement over the first edition. Peggy’s black-and-white illustrations are located\\nwith the herb under discussion. Thanks to the benevolence of Natures Herbs, A Twinlab Division,\\nwe are able to include ~150 color plates of most of the popularly marketed herbs in the U.S. We\\ngive special thanks to Grace Lyn Rich and Steve Welling for making this possible.\\nI hope the second edition of the Handbook of Medicinal Herbs will help patients and physicians\\nalike to use the safer herbs even more safely and wisely, and help steer them to the safer herbal\\nalternatives and away from some of the more dangerous pharmaceutical alternatives.\\nJames A. Duke\\nAcknowledgments\\nAlthough this second edition is clearly the work of many people, I use I in the introduction, and\\nacknowledgment and often in the text. There is no shorter, less ambiguous word in the world than\\nthe word “I.” I could have said “the author” or “the authors” instead of “I” or “we” and really\\nintroduced ambiguities, but my coauthors don’t share all my views, so the buck stops here. I\\nacknowledge with deep gratitude and with apologies, my coauthors: Mary Jo Bogenschutz-Godwin,\\nwho has worked with me more than a decade, rewriting from my terrible sows-ear drafts to produce\\nthe proverbial silk purse; Judi duCellier, who has worked with me 25 years and survived the\\nevolution of my creeping dyslexia; Peggy-Ann Kessler Duke, friend for nearly 50 years and wife\\nfor more than 40; botanical illustrator par excellence, whose more than 300 illustrations are worth\\nmore than my 300,000 words; and to CRC Press publisher, Barbara Norwitz, who for more than\\n5 years has seen me slip and slide in and out of proposed contracts to do this second edition. To\\nthese praiseworthy women accrue all the compliments for this massive volume. The errors are mine.\\nAll science books are built on what has gone before, hopefully seizing the best and discarding\\nthe worst. It’s not plagiarism if one cites one’s sources. I am deeply indebted to all those scientific\\nwriters with and before me, who have written about phytochemicals and phytopharmacy; and to\\nour ancestors before them, who sampled the plants around them, and learned which were edible,\\nmedicinal, and poisonous, and who lived to talk about it.\\nAlso let me acknowledge you, my readers, for struggling with this, my most ponderous,\\nyet I hope most useful, book. If you like it and find any errors, let me know. I hope to keep\\nit updated on my computer at home. Then maybe Barbara and CRC Press, maybe even you,\\nwill be ready for a third edition. New scientific data are pouring in, hopefully proving me\\nright, that herbal phytochemicals are cheaper and safer, on average, and often as efficacious,\\nas competitive pharmaceuticals.\\nJames A. Duke\\nThe Author\\nJames A. “Jim” Duke, Ph.D., is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of North Carolina,\\nwhere he received his Ph.D. in Botany. He then moved on to postdoctoral activities at Washington\\nUniversity and the Missouri Botanical Gardens in St. Louis, Missouri, where he assumed professor\\nand curator duties, respectively. He retired from the United States Department of Agriculture\\n(USDA) in 1995 after a 35-year career there and elsewhere as an economic botanist. After retiring,\\nhe was appointed Senior Scientific Consultant to Nature’s Herbs (A Twin Labs subsidiary), and to\\nan online company, ALLHERB.COM. He currently teaches a master’s degree course in botanical\\nhealing at the Tai Sophia Institute in Columbia, Maryland.\\nDr. Duke spends time exploring the ecology and culture of the Amazonian Rain Forest and sits\\non the board of directors and advisory councils of numerous organizations involved in plant\\nmedicine and the rainforest.

She also experienced several\\nA\\nmonths of secondary amenorrhea. Of senna leaf, Blumenthal et al. lists abdominal pain of\\nunknown origin, acute intestinal inflammation (e.g., Crohn’s disease and colitis ulcerosa), and\\nappendicitis as contraindications. Because of the anthraquinones, nonstandardized preparations\\nshould be avoided during pregnancy and lactation (CAN). “Anthraquinones may be secreted\\ninto breast milk” (CAN). Should not be used in lactation, pregnancy, or with children under\\n12 years old (KOM). Occasional cramp-like discomfort of the GI tract may require dosage\\nreduction (KOM). Side effects with chronic abuse: disturbance of electrolyte balance, espe-\\ncially hypokalemia (may be exacerbated by simultaneous administration of corticoadrenal\\nsteroids, licorice root, or thiazide diuretics), leading to cardiopathy, muscular weakness espe-\\ncially with concurrent uses of cardiac glycosides, corticosteroids, or diuretics (KOM). Pig-\\nmentation of the intestinal mucosae (pseudomelanosis coli) is harmless and usually reverses\\non discontinuation of the drug. Laxative like this should not be used more than 1–2 weeks\\nwithout medical advice (KOM). CAN report anthraquinones are purgative and irritate GI tract.\\nAlso contraindicated in hemorrhoids and nephropathy (CAN), intestinal obstruction, abdominal\\npain of unknown causes, any enterosis (appendicitis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome) hemorrhoids, nephropathy, menstruation (AHP). Do not use more than 8–10 days\\n(AHP). Do not use this in case of abdominal pain or diarrhea. Consult a health care provider\\nprior to use in pregnancy or nursing. Discontinue use if diarrhea or watery stools occur. Not\\nfor long term use (AHP). “Some herbal laxative preparations, such as cascara and senna for\\nexample, can cause an increase in the potency of digoxin” (D’epiro, 1997). Pedersen (1998)\\ncautions against taking the fresh leaf (we have done that in Peru with modest laxative results).\\n“Senna causes gripping unless taken in combination with carminative herbs such as ginger,\\ncloves, or various mint species.” Although GRAS, senna can be more habit-forming than\\ncascara (PED).

It\\nhas been proposed that the laxative and toxic components of senna could be separated” (CAN).\\nElsewhere, I have read that the sennosides are synergetic as far as their laxative action is\\nconcerned.

One\\npatient died from listerosis after ingesting contaminated alfalfa tablets (LRNP, March 1991).\\nSeeds and/or sprouts may contain 13,000 ppm canavanine, which may be implicated in hypo-\\ncomplementenemia, lupus, and pancytopenia. Canavanine, a toxic amino acid, may cause\\nsystemic lupus erythematosus syndrome (CAN). Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like\\nmanifestations, skin reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, raised serum urate levels are symp-\\ntoms that have been associated with alfalfa use in humans. Seeds should not be ingested during\\npregnancy or lactation (CAN). May cause stomach upset and diarrhea. Believed by some\\nherbalists to be helpful in delaying absorption of cholesterol and dissolving plaque deposits on\\narterial walls (TMA). Consumption of alfalfa tablets contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes\\nwas linked to a fatal case of listerosis. One case of allergic reaction (from contamination with\\ngrass pollen) in alfalfa tablets has been reported (SF2). Flatulence, abdominal discomfort, loose\\nstools, diarrhea, and loss of appetite may result from ingesting large amounts of alfalfa seeds\\n(120 g/day).\\nExtracts (Alfalfa) — Purines in seeds may raise mean serum urate levels (AEH). Porphyrins may\\nphotosensitize (PNC). Saponins decrease plasma cholesterol without changing HDL cholesterol,\\ndecrease intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase excretion of neutral steroids and bile acids,\\nand prevent atherosclerosis. Saponins hemolytic, may interfere with vitamin E utilization. Root\\nsaponins, selectively antiyeast and fungicide, also hypocholesterolemic, in monkeys (CAN). “Sapo-\\nnin contents act on the cardiovascular, nervous and digestive systems” (PHR). Alfalfa sprouts, not\\nrecommended, contain trace of COX-2 inhibitor apigenin (70 ppm ZMB) (COX). Forty g heat-\\ntreated alfalfa seed, 3 ×/day/8 weeks, helped normalize serum cholesterol concentrations in Type\\n2 hyperlipoproteinanemia.

Here, I have tried to sort\\nout what I think was intended by the authors, mostly also compilers like myself, interpreting\\nthe studies of others.

At 5 g/kg orl cat, the\\nleaves cause the same intoxication as a toxic dose of hydroquinone (HH2).

One of the products apricot seed components break down into in the human\\nbody is highly toxic prussic acid. Fifty to 60 kernels of apricot seed can kill adults; 7–10 can\\nbe fatal in children. My CRC handbook says that a “double kernel is said to be enough to kill\\na man” (CRC). I think that is overkill. Headache and nausea occurred in some patients being\\ntreated for chronic bronchosis with a paste of apricot seed and sugar. Possible adverse interaction\\nwhen taken with Astragalus, skullcap, or kudzu root (TMA, 1996). Kernels may cause contact\\ndermatosis. Cyanogenetic glycosides in the seed can cause cyanide poisoning (CAN). Because\\nof cyanide toxicity, apricots use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. Avoid in pregnancy;\\ningestion of cyanogenic substances may be teratogenic. Oral doses of 50 mg HCN (+~ 30 g\\nkernels = 50–60 kernels with ca 2000 ppm HCN). More than 20 deaths have been reported\\nfrom laetrile and apricot kernel ingestion (CAN). Symptoms of acute intoxication include\\nconvulsions, dizziness, drowsiness, dyspnea, headache, hypotension, nausea, paralysis, coma,\\nand then death. Death may occur from 1 to 15 minutes after ingestion. Antidotes for cyanide\\npoisoning include aminophenol, cobalt edetate, hydroxocobalamin, nitrite, and thiosulphate.\\nSymptoms of chronic intoxication (from HCN, cyanogenic foods, or drugs such as laetrile)\\ninclude ataxia, blindness, cretinism, goiter, hypertonia, increased blood thiocyanate, lesions of\\nthe optic nerve, mental retardation, and thyroid cancer. Demyelinating lesions and other neu-\\nromyopathies may occur secondary to chronic cyanide exposure, including long-term laetrile\\ntherapy. Agranulocytosis has also been attributed to long-term laetrile therapy. Laetrile, spelled\\nwith capital L, signifies a synthetic patented in 1961 but never sold in the U.S. Spelled with a\\nsmall l, laetrile is, for lay purposes, synonymous with amygdalin. After making this distinction,\\nAPA spells it with small l, except of course, at the beginning of a sentence, when they say,\\n“Laetrile consists of 6 percent cyanide (prussic or hydrocyanic acid), a highly poisonous\\nsubstance that can kill by depriving the brain of oxygen.” Then they unleash a hyperbolic error,\\nI presume, “the laetrile content of apricot pits varies from as much as 8 percent in some apricot\\nvarieties to twenty times that amount in wild varieties.” Krebs marketed laetrile with a small l\\nas vitamin B-17 (AHA).\\nClinical (Apricot) — A retrospective analysis of laetrile in patients with cancer showed slight\\nactivity. A subsequent clinical trial concluded that laetrile was ineffective in cancer treatment.\\nClaims for laetrile were based on three different theories: (1) Claimed that cancerous cells\\ncontained copious beta-glucosidases, which release HCN from laetrile via hydrolysis. Normal\\n36 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\ncells were reportedly unaffected because they contained low concentrations of beta-glucosidases\\nA\\nand high concentrations of rhodanese, which converts HCN to the less toxic thiocyanate. Later,\\nhowever, it was shown that both cancerous and normal cells contain only trace amounts of beta-\\nglucosidases, and similar amounts of rhodanese. Also, it was thought that amygdalin was not\\nabsorbed intact from the gastrointestinal tract (CAN); (2) Proposed that after ingestion, amygdalin\\nwas hydrolyzed to mandelonitrile, transported intact to the liver and converted to a beta-glucu-\\nronide complex, which was then carried to the cancerous cells, hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidases\\nto release mandelonitrile, and then HCN. This was believed an untenable theory; (3) Called\\nlaetrile vitamin B-17, and with that, cancer is a result of B-17-deficiency. It postulated that\\nchronic administration of laetrile would prevent cancer. No evidence was adduced to substantiate\\nthis hypothesis. Furthermore, it was even claimed that patients taking laetrile reduced their life\\nexpectancy, both through of lack of proper medical care and chronic cyanide poisoning. In order\\nto reduce potential risks to the general public, amygdalin was made a prescription-only medicine\\nin 1984 (CAN).\\nARAROBA (Andira araroba Aguan) +\\nActivities (Araroba) — Allergenic (1; PH2); Alterative (f; CRC); Antispasmodic (f; EFS); Bitter\\n(f; PHR); Detergent (f; CRC); Glucose-6-Phosphate-Dehydrogenase-Inhibitor (1; PH2); Irritant (1;\\nPH2); Poison (f; CRC); Taenifuge (f; CRC); Vermifuge (f; CRC).\\nIndications (Araroba) — Acne (f; GMH); Alopecia (f; CRC; EFS); Arthrosis (f; CRC); Cramp\\n(f; EFS); Dermatosis (f; CRC; PHR; PH2); Eczema (f; CRC; GMH); Fungus (f; CRC; PH2);\\nHemorrhoid (f; GMH); Herpes (f; CRC); Mastosis (f; GMH); Mycosis (f; PHR; PH2); Pityriasis\\n(f; CRC); Psoriasis (f; CRC); Rheumatism (f; CRC); Ringworm (f; CRC; GMH); Tapeworm (f;\\nCRC); Trichophytosis (1; CRC); Tylosis (f; GMH); Worm (f; CRC).\\nDosages (Araroba) — One-half grain (GMH).\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Araroba) — Not in AHP; APA; KOM.\\nCaution: easily absorbed dermally and potentially nephrotoxic (EFS); 200 mg internally can induce\\ndiarrhea, nausea, and nephrosis.

If you can believe\\nthe herbal PDR (2000) of Gruenwald et al., plantain fruits (p. 597) contain 28 million ppm serotonin,\\non a fresh weight basis; perhaps 10 times more on a dry weight basis, 7 million ppm tyramine, on\\na fresh weight basis; perhaps 10 times more on a dry weight basis; 8 million ppm dopamine, on a\\nfresh weight basis; perhaps 10 times more on a dry weight basis, and only 2 million ppm norad-\\nrenaline, on a fresh weight basis; perhaps 10 times more on a dry weight basis. That would more\\nthan rationalize his suggestions that plantain is used to prepare a narcotic drink. No, we have no\\nbananas. Gruenwald probably had µg/g rather than g/g in mind. At any rate, I'll not cite these\\nfigures in my database. This happens to me so often; I have an italicized µg/g in an abstract and\\nthe e-mail drops the µ and then I have g/g instead of µg/g.\\n56 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nBANEBERRY (Actaea spicata L.)

Unapproved\\n(KOM). (Several species mentioned. Should this be included since it is written up as the alkaloid\\nberberine?) Possibly hepatotoxic. Oral administration appeared to cause nausea, emesis, diarrhea,\\nrenal irritation, and nephrosis in unanesthetized dogs. Canadians do not allow berberine contain-\\ning bark, even in alcoholic beverages. Commission E reports no risks are known for the fruit,\\nbut other parts contain the alkaloid berberine (AEH). One source says high doses are dangerous,\\nbut Commission E says that berberine at 500 mg (equiv. to >8 g root bark with 6.1% alkaloid)\\nis well tolerated (KOM). But high dosages (of berberine) may generate serious dyspnea and\\nspasms, ending in lethal primary paralysis of the respiratory system (25 mg/kg in cats and dogs).\\nSuch doses may also cause hemorrhagic nephrosis (KOM). Death from berberine has been\\nreported (MAB). I suspect the herbal PDR erred in saying of the root bark, “Dosages over 4 mg\\nwill bring about light stupor, nosebleeds, vomiting, diarrhea, and kidney irritation.” It also said,\\n“No health hazards or side effects are known in conjunction with the proper administration of\\ndesignated therapeutic dosages” (PH2), and gave 2 g as root bark dosage (Gruenwald, 2000).\\nThough no toxicity problems have been observed so far, avoid preparations during pregnancy\\ndue to uterotonic activity (PNC). Contraindicated for pregnant women due to its stimulant effect\\non the uterus. Berberine is reportedly mutagenic in yeast cells and Ames test (intercalation into\\nthe DNA) (PH2). Upset stomach, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or faintness may occur.\\nConvulsions, drastic lowering of blood pressure, heart rate, or respiration may be caused by large\\ndoses of barberry. In cases of heart disease or chronic respiratory conditions, consult health care\\npractitioner before using (TMA, 1996). If Barney is right in saying that “goldenseal should not\\nbe taken for long periods of time,” I suspect that the same would be true for those herbs containing\\nsimilar compounds, such as barberry, goldthread, oregon grape, and yellowroot. Therefore, I\\nlowered their safety ratings to 1+ (Barney, 1996).\\nExtracts (Barberry) — Berbamine strongly active against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas\\naeruginosa, Salmonella typhii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus viridans. Berbamine\\nincreases white blood cell and platelet counts in animals; used in China for “essential hypoten-\\nsion” (PNC) and leukopenia following chemotherapy and/or radiation. Palmatine anticholinest-\\nerase, hypotensive, and uterostimulant. Jatrorrhizine antifungal, hypotensive, and sedative. Mag-\\nnoflorine and oxyacanthine also hypotensive.

One\\ngram of the cytotoxic hydroquinone, equivalent to 6–20 g plant material, totally extracted (I\\npresume) has caused collapse, convulsions, cyanosis, delirium, nausea, shortness of breath, tinnitus,\\nand vomiting. Five grams has proved fatal. Because of high tannin content, prolonged use of uva-\\nursi may cause chronic liver impairment. Since large doses are reportedly oxytocic, and in view\\nof hydroquinone’s toxicity, “the use of uva-ursi during pregnancy and lactation is best avoided,”\\nbut in the last paragraph on page 259, the hydroquinone concentrations “provided by ingestion of\\ntherapeutic doses of uva-ursi are not thought to represent a risk to human health” (CAN).\\nExtracts (Bearberry) — Aqueous and methanol extracts molluscicidal at 50 ppm. Antiseptic\\n(bactericidal) activity of arbutin, at least on urinary-tract bacteria, depends on beta-glucosidase\\nactivity of the microbe, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus being highest, Bacillus,\\nMycobacterium, Shigella, and Staphylococcus apparently intermediate, with Escherichia being\\nlowest. Arbutin is absorbed from the GI tract virtually unchanged. During renal excretion, it is\\nhydrolyzed to the active principle, hydroquinone, which exerts an antiseptic and astringent action\\non the urinary mucous membranes. The crude extract is reportedly more effective than isolated\\narbutin, due to other chemicals that may also yield hydroquinone. Gallic acid in the crude extract\\nmay prevent beta-glucosidase cleavage of arbutin in the GI tract before absorption, thereby\\ndelivering more hydroquinone in renal excretion (CAN). Methanol extract (50%) inhibits tyro-\\nsinase. This could also inhibit the formation of melanin from DOPA (KOM). LD50 2% hydro-\\nquinone = 320–550 mg/kg orl (MAB); Arbutin = codeine as antitussive and stronger than the\\nnon-narcotic dropropizine (MAB).\\nBEAUTY BERRY (Callicarpa americana L.) +\\nActivities (Beauty Berry) — Algicide (1; JAF48:3008); Cyanobactericide (1; JAF48:3008);\\nDepurative (f; FAD); Diuretic (f; DEM); Fungicide (1; JAF48:3008); Herbicide (1;\\nJAF48:3008).\\nIndications (Beauty Berry) — Cancer (f; JLH); Cancer, skin (f; JLH); Colic (f; DEM); Dermatosis\\n(f; DEM; JLH); Dizziness (f; DEM); Dropsy (f; FAD); Dysentery (f; DEM); Dysuria (f; DEM);\\nEnterosis (f; DEM); Fever (f; DEM); Fungus (1; JAF48:3008); Gastrosis (f; DEM); Infection (1;\\nJAF48:3008); Itch (f; DEM); Malaria (f; DEM); Mycosis (1; JAF48:3008); Rheumatism (f; DEM);\\nStomachache (f; DEM); Water Retention (f; DEM).\\n68 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nBEE BALM (Monarda didyma L.) +++\\nB\\nActivities (Bee Balm) — Abortifacient (f; DEM); Antipyretic (f; PHR); Antispasmodic (f; PHR);\\nCarminative (f; FAD); Diaphoretic (f; FAD); Digestive (f; PHR); Diuretic (f; DEM; PHR); Vermi-\\nfuge (f; FAD).\\nIndications (Bee Balm) — Cardiopathy (f; FAD); Cold (f; FAD); Colic (f; DEM; FAD); Cramp\\n(f; PHR); Dysmenorrhea (f; PHR); Dyspepsia (f; PHR); Fever (f; FAD; PHR); Gas (f; DEM; FAD;\\nPHR); Headache (f; DEM; FAD); Hysteria (f; DEM); Insomnia (f; DEM; FAD); Measles (f; FAD);\\nNosebleed (f; DEM; FAD); Stomachache (f; DEM; FAD); Water Retention (f; DEM; PHR); Worm\\n(f; FAD).\\nDosages (Bee Balm) — 2–6 g in tea (JAD).\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Bee Balm) — None reported (PHR).

Interpretations of Commission E\\napprovals vary slightly: Blumenthal et al. (1998) approve 20–60 g fruit for nonspecific acute diarrhea\\nand local therapy of mild inflammation of the mucous membranes of mouth and throat. Gruenwald\\net al. (1998) approve the fruits (not leaves) for diarrhea, pharyngosis, and stomatosis. Neither\\napparently approve for the indications for which I take bilberry, preventing further deterioration of\\nthe eyesight (e.g. maculitis, poor night vision, (nyctalopia)). Since bilberry is a healthy food\\npharmaceutical I’ll take the good old bilberry in spite of its disapproval by these scholastic tomes.\\nIt’s even richer in eye-preserving anthocyanosides than our native blueberries.\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Bilberry) — Fruits, Class 1; Leaf, Class\\n4 (AHP). Leaves can be poisonous consumed over a long period of time (TMA, 1996). Com-\\n76 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nmission E reports leaf not permitted for therapeutic use; higher doses or prolonged use can\\nproduce chronic poisoning; chronic administration of 1.5 g/kg/day is lethal in some animals\\n(AEH). For fruits, none reported (PIP). “Bilberry does not interact with commonly prescribed\\nB\\ndrugs; no known contraindications in use during pregnancy or lactation; no known side effects\\nwith bilberry extracts” (SKY). Berries contain anthocyanosides, said to be helpful in treating\\neye problems, diarrhea, reducing arterial deposits, and lowering blood sugar in diabetics. Fresh\\nberries may cause diarrhea.\\nExtracts (Bilberry) — Flavonoids antiaggregant, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antispasmodic,\\npreserve capillaries and collagen (PED). Anthocyanosides inhibited barium-induced contraction of\\nisolated thoracic vein and coronary artery smooth muscle, in vitro, possibly by vasodilatory pros-\\ntaglandin production (PNC). Chromium content (of the leaves) may underlie antidiabetic activity\\n(PHR). Anthocyanins and polyphenols in berries of several Ribes, Rubus, and Vaccinium spp. have\\nin vitro antiradical activity on chemically generated superoxide radicals. The extracts also inhibit\\nxanthine oxidase. All crude extracts were highly active toward chemically generated superoxide\\nradicals. Ribes nigrum extracts exhibited most activity, being the richest in both anthocyanins and\\npolyphenols. But Ribes rubrum extracts seem to contain more active substances (X1332092).\\nBilberry extracts (equivalent to 9–72 mg/kg anthocyanins) sometimes exceeded carbenoxolone or\\ncimetidine in antiulcer activity (MAB).\\nBIRCH (Betula spp.) ++\\nBetula pendula Roth, Betula pubescens Ehrh.

No\\ncontraindications/drug interactions noted (KOM). I got a challenging letter from German parties\\nwith an economic interest in cohosh, asking where I got the cautionary remarks from in my 1985\\nCRC book. They must really be irritated by what follows: Commission E reports occasional gastric\\ncomplaints. Not to be used for more than 6 months (AEH). With prolonged use, may irritate the\\nuterus, cause dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, joint pains, and\\nlowered heart rate. Can contribute to abnormal blood clotting and liver problems. Can encourage\\nbreast tumors. Should not be used by anyone with any type of heart disease or by anyone advised\\nnot to take oral contraceptives. “Women taking estrogen therapy should consult a physician before\\nusing black cohosh” (SKY). Can cause premature labor. Because of insufficient data, use during\\npregnancy and lactation is not advised. Should be used only under medical supervision (TMA,\\n1996). High doses may cause diaphoresis, dizziness, nausea, reduced pulse rate, visual disturbances,\\nand vomiting (CAN). Because of uterine estrogen receptor binding in vitro, its use in pregnancy\\nand lactation is to be avoided. What they say about black cohosh should be templated and said for\\nevery herb, “It has been recommended that black cohosh should only be used in therapeutic doses,\\nand that high doses are potentially dangerous” (CAN). “Canadian regulations do not allow black\\ncohosh as a non-medicinal ingredient for oral use products” (Michols, 1995). Pedersen is not much\\nkinder, “Such constituents as tannins, gallic acid, and pseudotannins, including isoferulic acid, and\\nthe salicylates, are irritants to the skin, lungs, and kidneys. The drastic action of the irritant principles\\nin black cohosh are not lethal, but overdoses are characterized by nausea and headache” (PED).\\nSchulz et al. (1998) are nicer to this herb, sold in Germany and America, than the Anglos quoted\\nabove. In five studies using doses equivalent to 40 mg/day crude herb, there are no case reports of\\ntoxic effects from the herb, and there appears to be no specific toxicity associated with any of its\\nknown constituents. Two of the five showed mild side effects (dizziness, GI distress, headache, and\\nweight gain). No other contraindications are known. The duration of use should not exceed 3 months\\n(SHT). Cohosh extract augmented the activity of tamoxiphen (MAB). Finally, let me quote Gruen-\\nwald, editor-in-chief of the Herbal PDR, and coincidentally, also editor of the ABC Commission\\n88 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nE translation, because the two versions differ. “No health hazards or side effects are known in\\nconjunction with the proper administration of designated therapeutic dosages. An intake of very\\nhigh dosages of the drug (5 g) or an extract (12 g) leads to vomiting, headache, dizziness, limb\\nB\\npain, and lowered blood pressure.” He’s sanitizing or whitewashing if not ignoring the mild side\\neffects reported in two of the five German studies cited above. He refers to the gastric side effects\\nas adverse effects as distinct from side effects. I detect a whitewash of the cohosh, perhaps well\\ndeserved and scientifically accurate. Stay tuned.\\nExtracts (Black Cohosh) — Estrogenic and hypotensive effects reported (AHP). Resin hypotensive\\n(1 mg/kg). Triterpenes hypocholesterolemic. Formononetin binds to estrogen receptor sites, induc-\\ning an estrogen-like activity in the body (SKY). Alcoholic extracts decrease luteinizing hormone\\nsecretions in menopausal women (SKY). Cimicifugin antispasmodic and sedative (PED) but rapidly\\nconverted to an inactive compound when the fresh root is bruised or cut. Formononetin may act\\nas estradiol antagonist (binding to the receptor but not producing an effect) rather than an agonist\\n(binding to and activating the receptor), hence not affecting LH secretion (MAB). Studies of 13\\nAmerican populations of black cohosh refute the presence of formononetin.\\nBLACK CUMIN (Nigella sativa L.) ++\\nThe prophet Muhammad reportedly recommended black cumin as a “cure-all” to his associates in\\nArabia 1400 years ago.

Piperine inhibits calcium transport into the mitochondria, facilitates\\nmitochondrial release of calcium, and stimulates ATPase activity (SPI). Piperine is more potent\\nthan D-galactosamine in inhibiting glucuronidation. (ED50 with 3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene = 50\\nµM) (SPI). Piperine both depletes uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid and reduced the rate of\\nglucuronidation. This could lead to drug potentiation. Piperine is more toxic to houseflies than\\npyrethrin. A mix of 0.05% piperine and 0.01 pyrethrins is more toxic than 0.1% pyrethrin (WOI).\\nAccording to Rinzler, chavicine, piperidine, and piperine are all diaphoretic (but none of them were\\nin my database at home as such) (RIN). Ayurvedics often prescribe black pepper in a synergistic\\ntriad called trikatu, with ginger and long pepper (DEP). In addition to 0.54% mixed tocopherols\\nin the oleoresin (including 0.1% alpha-tocopherol), pepper contains five phenolic amides that are\\nsuperior as antioxidants to alpha tocopherol in vitro (SPI). Although pepper contains the carcinogen\\nsafrole, it is at very low levels compared to sassafras.

Topical StX should\\ncontain, methinks 0.0225–0.075% capsaicin, but I see reports of 0.25–0.75% capsaicin (SF). Some\\npeople work with stronger ointments than mine (0.025–0.075% capsaicin); Steve Foster gives levels\\nC\\n10 times higher, and CAN 100 times higher (for capsaicinoids). I consider these higher levels too\\nstrong, if not dangerous.\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Capsicum) — Class 2d. Contraindicated on\\nbroken skin or near eyes (AHP). Commission E reports contraindications: damaged skin, hyper-\\nsensitivity; adverse effects: irritant properties, rarely allergic reactions. Not to be used for more\\nthan 2 days, with 14-day lapse before reapplying (this is not often followed in this country) (AEH).\\nThe Herbal PDR suggests the same. Not for children under 2 years (WAM). CAN reports capsai-\\ncinoids to be irritant, “The toxicity of the capsaicinoids has reportedly not been ascribed to any\\none specific action but may be due to their causing respiratory failure, bradycardia, and hypoten-\\nsion.” Chronic administration of capsicum extract (0.5 µg capsaicin/kg body weight; that would\\nbe 50 µg (micrograms) for this 100-kilo rat) to hamsters has been reported toxic (CAN). The oral\\nLD50 in rats is 190 mg/kg (CAN). The oral LD50 97–294 in mice is such that led TAD to calculate\\nthat for me, a 220-lb (100 kg) rat, I’d need to ingest some 135 to 415 ounces of hot pepper. No\\nway (TAD). Capsicum may interfere with blood pressure medicines and MAOIs (CAN). Paprika\\nand/or capsicum may speed other medications (reading that, I went and tried a mixture of grapefruit\\njuice with black pepper and Tabasco, three well known potentiators of medications). Interesting.\\nSpicy, but good. Sure beats taking my less-spicy herb (or synthetics for those more unfortunate\\nthan I). Digestive properties of capsaicin may be attributed to an enhancement of digestive enzyme\\nactivities or to indirect effects on vascular endothelia, smooth muscles, and mast cells, resulting in\\nincrease of vascular permeability and of mucosal blood flow. Antigens have been associated with\\nanaphylaxis and rhinoconjunctivitis (PH2). Hot spices can promote antigen transfer through epi-\\nthelia and thereby augment sensitization or allergic reactions. Unfortunately, it may also speed up\\nhepatic metabolism of many drugs, effectively rendering them weaker. Many of my correspondents\\nfind the capsaicin cure worse than their aching ailment. Fleming et al. (1998) have some heavy\\nduty toxicity info: toxic dosages, possibly leading to life-threatening hypothermia by affecting the\\nthermoreceptors. Excessive consumption may cause gastroenterosis, hepatic or renal damage\\n(CAN), or ulcers (SKY). Prolonged consumption of high doses can cause chronic gastrosis, kidney\\nand liver damage, and neurotoxicity (PHR). Prolonged exposure may deaden the sensitivity to any\\npain (PED). “Prolonged exposure to mucosa will make the mucosa insensitive to industrial pollu-\\ntion” (PED). I don’t know whether that’s supposed to be a plus or a minus (JAD).\\nCARAMBOLA (Averrhoa carambola L.) ++\\nActivities (Carambola) — Abortifacient (f; WO2); Antidote (f; WO2); Antiinflammatory (f; WO2);\\nAntipyretic (f; DEP; SKJ); Emetic (f; WO2); Emmenagogue (f; WO2); Fungicide (f; WO2);\\nHemostat (f; SKJ); Lactagogue (f; WO2); Parasiticide (f; WO2); Sialagogue (f; SKJ); Vermifuge\\n(f; WO2).\\nIndications (Carambola) — Alactea (f; WO2); Amenorrhea (f; WO2); Angina (f; WO2); Aphtha\\n(f; WO2); Bleeding (f; SKJ); Chickenpox (f; WO2); Colic (f; WO2); Diarrhea (f; PH2); Dysentery\\n(f; WO2); Fever (f; DEP; PH2; SKJ); Fungus (f; WO2); Headache (f; WO2); Hemorrhoid (f;\\nPH2); Hepatosis (f; PH2; WO2); Infection (f; WO2); Inflammation (f; WO2); Malaria (f; PH2);\\nMycosis (f; WO2); Pain (f; PH2); Parasite (f; WO2); Ringworm (f; WO2); Scabies (f; PH2);\\nStress (f; SKJ); Thirst (f; PH2); Vomiting (f; PH2); Worm (f; WO2); Wound (f; DAA); Xerostoma\\n(f; DAA).\\n152 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nDosages (Carambola) — Fruits food farmacy (JAD).

Do not use bark that has not been heat-treated or\\naged 1 year (AHP). While widely used, anthranoid-containing laxatives can be habit forming; some\\ncontain compounds suspected of being cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and even tumorigenic; epide-\\nmiological studies in Germany reveal that abusers of anthranoid laxatives have three times higher rate\\nof colon carcinoma (AEH). “Some herbal laxative preparations such as cascara, for example, can cause\\nan increase in the potency of digoxin” (D’epiro, 1997). Chronic use may lead to hypokalemia, increasing\\nefficacy, perhaps dangerously, of cardiac glycosides, perhaps antiarrhythmics. Hypokalemia can be\\nincreased with corticosteroids, diuretics, and licorice root (KOM). Cathartic cascarosides induce the\\nlarge intestine to increased peristalsis, inducing bowel movement.

Contraindicated\\nin intestinal obstruction and abdominal pain of unknown origin, appendicitis, inflammatory\\nbowel disease; do not use more than 8–10 days (AHP; PHR). “Hazards and/or side effects not\\nknown for proper therapeutic dosages of the oil” (PH2). Overdoses can cause colic, drastic\\ndiarrhea, gastralgia and gastrosis, queasiness, and vomiting (PHR). The seeds contain 2.8–3%\\ntoxic substances, requiring 2.5–20 seed to kill a man (chewing a single seed may be fatal to\\na child), 4 to kill a rabbit, 5 a sheep, 6 an ox, 6 a horse, 7 a pig, 11 a dog, but 80 for a cock\\nor duck. The principal toxin is the albumin, ricin (DAD). Though some recommend in preg-\\nnancy, others do not. Midwives sometimes use the oil to induce labor (AHP). Refined oil\\ncontraindications: intestinal obstruction, unexplained stomachache; adverse effects: frequent\\nuse produces electrolyte losses (interaction with cardiac glycosides), also gastric irritation,\\nand allergic skin reactions. Should not be used for prolonged periods (AEH). Not for children\\nunder 12 years old (PHR). May induce dermatosis as well as cure it (FAD).\\nExtracts (Castor) — Ricin, the deadly poison, can be attached to monoclonal antibodies that attack\\nonly cancer cells, a technique reportedly tried in 1000 patients with cancer (DAD). The AIDS virus\\ncan infect an immune cell by locking onto its cell receptor protein “CD4.” By genetically attaching\\nthe ricin to genetically engineered CD4 proteins, one obtains CD4-ricin, which will lock onto the\\nexternal viruses of infected cells, 1000 times more often than onto healthy cells, possibly killing\\nenough infected cells to prevent the spread of the disease symptoms. Like the botulism toxin, ricin\\ncan be used to kill overstimulated nerve endings in patients with dystonias (DAD).

No contraindications, drug interactions, or side effects known (KOM). None reported (PIP).\\n176 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nSome people advise, perhaps overadvise, that sensitive people may have an allergic reaction to this.\\nI don't take chamomile daily, but almost daily I ingest a whole lot of peanuts, which are more\\ndangerous, anaphylactically killing two people a year in the U.S. Patients who are allergic to\\nragweed, however, may experience cross-reactivity with chamomile, which can produce intense\\nitching in the mouth if the mucosa becomes highly irritated (O’Brien, 1998). CAN cautions that\\nC\\nthe sesquiterpene lactones can cause allergic reactions. They add that cross-sensitivities with other\\naster relatives (WAM) and celery exist. Because it is reputed to affect the menstrual cycle and to\\nbe a uterine stimulant, with excessive use, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided (CAN).\\nBut SKY says no contraindications during pregnancy or lactation (SKY). Not recommended for\\nteething babies. Because of coumarin content, may interfere with anticoagulant therapy (CAN).\\nHighly concentrated hot tea is reportedly emetic. Some advise against daily use, but I would not.\\nKeep all hot teas at a distance from the eyes (AHP). Oral administration of chamomile extract\\ninduced a deep sleep in 10 of 12 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization (CAN). Reported as\\nan effective treatment for mucosal infections. Diluted extracts used as a mouthwash 5 to 6 times\\ndaily provided astringent and cooling effects (CAN). Chamomile preparations and their components\\nworked on the inflammatory mediators of the arachidonic acid cascade; they inhibit cyclooxygenase\\nand 5-lipoxygenase. Chamomile is so far my best source of COX-2 inhibitor apigenin (to 0.8%\\nZMB) followed by celery (to 0.2%), making celery stalks the best food farmacy source (COX).\\nExtracts (Chamomile) — Chamomile oils analgesic, antianaphylactic, antiinflammatory, anti-\\npyretic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, bactericidal, and fungicidal (PED). Azulenes, documented as\\naniinflammatory and hypoallergenic, may prevent allergic seizures in guinea pigs, perhaps through\\nantihistaminic activity. EO LD50 = >5000 orl rabbit (CAN); LD50 = >5000 der rabbit (CAN);\\nLD50 = 2.5 ml/kg orl mouse (CAN). High molecular weight polysaccharides are immunostimulant;\\ncholeretic, hypouremic, and hypocholesterolemic at 0.1 ml/kg in cats and dogs, cardiodepressant,\\nhypotensive, and respiradepressant at 0.2 ml/kg (CAN). Bisabolol and flavonoids are responsible\\nfor antispasmodic activities. Apigenin was three times as effective as papaverine; bisabolol was\\ncomparable. Smooth muscle relaxant properties documented for a cis-spiroether. Antiinflammatory\\nactivity documented for the sesquiterpene bisabolol compounds. (–)-alpha-bisabolol protects against\\nthe gastric effects of aspirin (PH2). Flavonoids antiinflammatory. Chamomile oil (25 mg/ml;\\nbisabolol at 1 mg/ml) was active against bacteria (especially Gram positive), fungi, and Candida\\nalbicans. Apigenin and luteolin are more active antiinflammatories than indomethacin and phe-\\nnylbutazone (WHO). “Chamazulene, a-bisabolol, and flavones such as apigenin were the single\\ncomponents that were found to have the strongest antiinflammatory activity, but most studies found\\nthat the whole extracts were more active than their individual components” (SHT). Chamomile\\nextract in a cream base was superior to hydrocortisone 0.25% for reducing skin inflammation. For\\neczema, chamomile was as good as hydrocortisone (0.25%), and better than fluocortin butyl ester\\n(0.75%) and bufexamac (5%) (WHO). Extracts based on fresh flowers equaled antiinflammatory\\nactivity of benzydamine (MAB).\\nCHAMPAC (Michelia champaca L.) ++\\nActivities (Champac) — Abortifacient (f; SKJ); Alexeteric (f; KAB); Antifertility (f; SKJ); Anti-\\npyretic (f; KAB; SKJ; SUW); Antispasmodic (f; KAB; SUW); Aphrodisiac (f; KAB); Astringent (f;\\nKAB; SUW); Bitter (f; KAB; SUW); Carminative (f; SKJ; SUW); Demulcent (f; KAP); Deobstruent\\n(f; KAP); Deodorant (f; KAB); Depurative (f; KAB); Diaphoretic (f; KAB; SKJ); Diuretic (f; KAB;\\nSKJ; SUW); Emmenagogue (f; KAB; SUW); Expectorant (f; DEP; KAB); Hypertensive (1; KAP);\\nHypoglycemic (1; KAP); Laxative (f; KAB); Stimulant (f; DEP; KAB; SKJ; SUW; WOI); Stomachic\\n(f; DEP; KAB; SUW); Tonic (f; KAB; SKJ; SUW); Vermifuge (f; DEP; KAB).\\nIndications (Champac) — Amenorrhea (f; KAB); Biliousness (f; KAB); Cancer (f; JLH);\\nCancer, abdomen (f; JLH); Cancer, colon (f; JLH); Colic (f; DEP; KAB; SUW); Constipation\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 177\\n(f; KAB); Cough (f; KAB); Cramp (f; KAB; SUW); Delirium (f; DEP); Dermatosis (f; KAB);\\nDiabetes (1; KAP); Dysmenorrhea (f; SKJ); Dyspepsia (f; KAB); Enterosis (f; JLH); Epigas-\\ntrosis (f; KAB); Fever (f; DEP; KAB; SKJ; SUW); Gas (f; DEP; SKJ; SUW); Gastrosis (f;\\nKAB; KAP); Gonorrhea (f; DEP; KAB; KAP; SUW); Gout (f; DEP; KAB; SUW; WOI);\\nHeadache (f; DEP; KAB; SUW); Hyperglycemia (1; KAP); Inflammation (f; KAB); Leprosy\\nC\\n(f; KAB); Low Blood Pressure (1; KAP); Malaria (f; DEP); Mania (f; DEP); Nausea (f; DEP;\\nKAB); Nephrosis (f; DEP; KAB); Ophthalmia (f; DEP; KAB; SUW); Ozena (f; KAB); Podiatry\\n(f; SUW); Rheumatism (f; DEP; KAB); Snakebite (f; KAB); Sore (f; KAB; SUW); Vaginosis\\n(f; KAB); VD (f; SUW); Vertigo (f; DEP; KAB; SUW); Water Retention (f; KAB; SKJ; SUW);\\nWorm (f; DEP; KAB).\\nCHAPARRAL, CREOSOTE BUSH\\n(Larrea tridentata (Sessé & Moc. ex DC.)

Vitex acting on the pituitary increasing\\nluteinizing hormone, helping reduce prolactin and increase progesterone (SKY). I suspect there was\\nan idiomatic problem leading PH2 to suggest that chaste tree inhibits lactation (main active principles\\naucubin and agnoside.

Coffee has been\\nimplicated in loss of calcium and magnesium in bones, which bodes ominous for osteoporosis\\ncandidates. It can also inhibit or interfere with iron absorption and help elevate cholesterol (JLR1(8):4.\\n1995). Toxicologically harmless (up to 5 cups or 500 mg caffeine) for healthy adults habituated to\\ncoffee (but hypertensive in neophytes taking 250 g coffee (1.25 cups), increasing systolic blood\\npressure some 10 mm Hg). Gruenwald et al. cautions are not exactly the same echos I am used to.\\nThey advise caution for those with disposition to convulsions and certain psychic disorders (such as\\npanic anxiety), nephrosis, sensitive cardiovascular system, and thyroid hyperfunction. Side effects\\nattributed in part to chlorogenic acid may include diarrhea, hyperacidity, inappetence, and stomach\\nirritation. Chronic consumption of >1500 mg/day can lead to diarrhea, dizziness, headache, inappe-\\ntence, irritability, palpitations, restlessness, sleeplessness, and vomiting. Higher doses lead to arrhyth-\\nmic spasms of different muscle groups, arrhythmic tachycardia, and opisthotonos. But not to worry!\\nFatal poisonings “are not conceivable.” They do reiterate the reported death of a child after ingesting\\n5300 mg caffeine. Ironically, that coffee charcoal that Commission E promotes for mussy mucosa\\nmight be the best antidote, along with sorbitol, for overdoses of caffeine. Nursing mothers may pass\\ncaffeine-induced insomnia to the nursing baby. Pregnant women should avoid caffeine, never exceed-\\ning 300 mg caffeine spread out over the day (PHR). LD50 caffeine = 5–10 g orl human (TRA).\\nExtracts (Coffee) — Not exactly an extract, the carbonized charcoal is described as absorbent and\\nastringent, like most charcoals. I hope that physicians will understand what is said in the Herbal\\nPDR, speaking of caffeine and not the charcoal, “it also increases the psychomotor stamina” (PHR).\\nChlorogenic acid, like caffeine alone, can double gastric secretion (PHR).

Because of the PAs, coltsfoot use in pregnancy and lactation\\nis to be avoided (CAN). Dosage maximum 10 g PA/day (herbal tea) or maximum 1 g PA/day\\n(extracts, expressed sap) for maximum 4–6 weeks/year (AEH).

This is the only herb (1.5–6 g\\nleaf/day) except related Petasites with toxic PAs still tolerated by Commission E. Still, CAN\\ncautions that coltsfoot is phototoxic in guinea pig skin. In guinea pig sensitization experiments,\\nit showed weak allergenic capacity, possibly due to the sesquiterpene lactones present in the\\nplant. PAs are toxic to humans, with liver damage with cirrhosis and ascites, or seneciosis, or\\nveno-occlusive disease (VOD) reported in almost all cases of severe or fatal intoxications,\\nfrom intakes of 0.5 mg/kg to 3.3 mg/kg (AEH1).

Do not apply to broken or abraded skin. Do not use when nursing” (AHP).\\nCanadians do not allow in food (Blackburn, 1993). Bisset says there is no danger of acute\\npoisoning when used as prescribed (Bisset, 1994). Hepatotoxicity of coltsfoot may be due to\\nsenkirkine (~150 ppm), highlighting the dangers of chronic exposure to even low doses of\\nPAs. Rats fed more than 4% coltsfoot in their diet develop hepatic tumors. Newborn rats are\\nmore susceptible than weanlings to hepatotoxicity of senkirkine despite lacking the hepatic\\nmicrosomal enzymes required to produce the toxic pyrrholic metabolites. Fatal hepatic veno-\\nocclusive disease was documented in a newborn infant whose mother chronically consumed\\nherb teas during pregnancy (coltsfoot and senecio specified). The mother exhibited no signs\\nof hepatic damage again suggesting increased sensitivity of the fetal liver to PA toxicity.\\nAnimal studies document placental transfer and secretion into breast milk of unsaturated PAs\\n(CAN).

Do I need to write out this caveat for all the salubrious bitter herbs of the Bible; Warning:\\nmay cause hyperacidity and gastric distress? Flavonoids antiinflammatory; increase urine flow.

CAN cautions that pulegone in the volatile oil can be irritant, hepatotoxic, and nephrotoxic.\\nSymptoms following EO ingestion include abdominal pain, agitation, diarrhea, high blood pressure,\\nlethargy, nausea, pyrexia, and generalized urticaria. Abortifacient doses are hepatotoxic and neph-\\nrotoxic. Because of pulegone’s abortifacient activity, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be\\navoided. “Both the internal and external use of pennyroyal oil has been contraindicated” (CAN).\\n284 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nDeath reported following ingestion of 15 ml (ca. 1/ oz) EO, after 2-week consumption of alcoholic\\n2\\nextract (with pulegone metabolites in the liver) (AHP). Playing it safe, I like to remind everyone\\nthat pregnant women are advised against taking (any medicine) this herb or others because the\\nherbs reportedly have some abortifacient properties. Further, pulegone, the active compound, is\\nreportedly absorbed through the skin and may be carcinogenic (I think the warning is overrated\\nbut would prefer to err on the side of caution). But many of our generally recommended as safe\\nmints also contain pulegone. Delaneyites (a group of adherents of the Delaney Cause, that anything\\ncontaining a carcinogen is a carcinogen) might outlaw peppermint, one of our best medicinal herbs.\\nThe Lawrence Review certainly puts pulegone at doubt. Pulegone is oxidized by hepatic cytochrome\\nE\\nP-450 to the hepatotoxic compound, menthofuran. Pulegone or a metabolite is also responsible for\\nneurotoxicity and destruction of bronchiolar epithelial cells. It extensively depletes glutathione in\\nthe liver. Hepatic toxicity from overdoses has been prevented with acetylcysteine administered\\npromptly. Rats at 80 to 160 mg/kg/day develop encephalopathies. Not to be toyed with. Pennyroyal\\noil is toxic and potentially fatal if ingested. Symptoms include abdominal cramps, abdominal pain,\\nnausea, vomiting, rash, dizziness, and alternating lethargy and agitation, leading to kidney failure,\\nmassive hepatic necrosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Five grams of pennyroyal oil\\ncan cause collapse; 11.69 g abortion, collapse, salivation, and unconsciousness. Serious toxicity\\nwith the tea has not been reported. CNS symptoms from ingesting pennyroyal-containing prepa-\\nrations include lethargy, agitation, dizziness, sometimes leading to seizures and auditory and visual\\nhallucinations. GI effects include nausea, vomiting, burning in the throat, abdominal pain, and\\ndiarrhea (AEH1).

The\\nliterature looks reasonably clean. I’ve heard from two separate personal cases of women taking\\nit satisfactorily for PMS, that it caused migraine-like headaches which they did not experience\\nbefore taking EPO. Anecdotal but credible. As one source of tryptophan, which may convert to\\ncerebral serotonin, it can alter brain levels of serotonin, which is involved in some migraine\\ncases. Colic, headache, and nausea may occur in a small percentage of subjects. CAN reports\\npatients with schizophrenia on phenothiazines may experience mild dyspepsia and/or increased\\nrisk of epilepsy. They rather give it a green light for breastfeeding mothers, since both linoleic\\nacid and gamma-linolenic acid are normally in breast milk (CAN). The conservative Miller and\\nMurray (1998) book says, “No adverse effects of EPO have been reported. Chronic toxicity and\\ncarcinogenicity studies of EPO in rats, mice, and dogs revealed no important adverse effects or\\ntumor differences” (MAM). The second edition of the Herbal PDR warns that EPO may possibly\\nlower the seizure threshold in patients being treated with drugs that lower the seizure threshold\\nin schizophrenia. One of the better sources of gamma-linolenic acid, often known as GLA (and\\nto some British as gamolenic acid), and tryptophan (FNF). Two large clinical trials with EPO\\nmatch clinical relief from cyclical breast pain with bromocriptine and danazol (side effects in\\nca. 33%) but with virtually no EPO side effects. For PMS, Vitex and nutrients (e.g., magnesium\\nand vitamin B6), are more promising than EPO (DON).\\nEVODIA (Tetradium ruticarpum (A. Juss.) T. G. Hartley) ++\\nSynonyms — Boymia ruticarpa A.

Since all herbs, spices, and food plants, like drugs, contain pharmaco-\\nlogically active ingredients, it seems it could go without saying, “the presence of pharmacologically\\nactive constituents would suggest that excessive ingestion is inadvisable” (CAN).

Oral feverfew\\nmay cause mouth ulcers in ca. 10% of patients. Should not be taken by pregnant women because\\nthe leaves have emmenagogue activity (LRNP, June 1990). No serious side effects have been noticed\\nin those taking feverfew over years as a preventive. Side effects: ulcerations of the mouth, sore\\ntongue, inflammation of the oral mucosa and tongue, swelling of the lips, unpleasant taste, loss of\\ntaste, urinary problems, headache, diarrhea, dry mouth, dusgeusia, gas, glossosis, hypersensitivity,\\nnausea, stomatosis, and vomiting (most were apparent only in the first week) reported by those\\nusing feverfew. Cases of allergic contact dermatosis in humans have also been reported (AEH).\\nCases of contact dermatosis are rare. Mild tranquilizing and sedative effects have been reported.\\nChewing the leaves for extended periods may lead to abdominal pains and dyspepsia. Sesquiterpene\\nlactones (SLs) are aromatic compounds widely distributed in certain plant families, with highest\\nconcentrations generally found in leaves and flowers. Sheep and cattle poisonings due to SL-\\ncontaining species have been reported. SLs are allergenic and may cause dermatosis (CAN).\\nBecause it is reputed to be abortifacient and to affect the menstrual cycle, its use in pregnancy and\\nlactation is to be avoided. “Self-medication with feverfew should not be undertaken without first\\nconsulting a doctor” (CAN). “Should not be used by children under the age of two years” (SKY).\\nDo not use with calcium channel blockers, ticlopadine, or coumadin (O’Brien, 1998).\\nExtracts (Feverfew) — Inhibit leukotriene, prostaglandin, and thromboxane production; inhibit\\nphospholipase A2 (facilitating the release of arachidonic acid from the phospholipid cellular mem-\\nbrane; clinical relevance questionable) (CAN). Extracts inhibit interaction of platelets with collagen\\nsubstrates. Inhibits granule secretion in blood platelets and neutrophils (associated with etiology\\nof migraine and rheumatoid arthrosis, respectively). SLs with an alpha-methylene butyrolactone\\nunit may explain antisecretory activity (CAN). Extracts produce a dose-dependent inhibition of\\nanti-IgE-induced histamine release from mast cells (differently than cromoglycate and quercetin)\\n(CAN).

Under pessimal\\nconditions, 100 g linseed can liberate up to 50 mg HCN, enough to bring about symptoms of\\npoisoning. But these conditions, rarely, if ever are maintained. Most HCN is metabolized via the\\nenzyme rhodanase, which can convert 30–60 mg HCN per hour into the relatively toxic thiocy-\\nanate.

Some thiol-\\nbearing compounds in garlic, onion, and their relatives can cause acantholysis in vitro (Brenner\\net al., 1995) and possibly pemphigus in vivo. “More than 5 cloves a day may induce gas and\\nheartburn (Castleman, 1996) and ‘thin blood’” (people taking blood thinners may thereby over-\\nthin their blood). “May potentiate the effect of antihypertensive and anticoagulant medications”\\n322 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\n(SHT). No known contraindications during pregnancy and lactation (SKY). Some people are\\nvery allergic to garlic. Contraindicated in hyperthyroidism (TRA). Commission E reports rare\\nGI disturbances, allergic reactions, change of odor of skin and breath. Sulphides may irritate\\nthe GI tract or cause dermatosis (CAN). Allergic reactions of contact dermatosis and severe\\nasthmatic attacks (from inhalation of garlic powder). Topical application of garlic or garlic oil\\nmay cause local irritating effects. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur following ingestion\\nof fresh garlic bulbs, extracts, or oil (AEH1). Fresh garlic is reportedly dangerous to children\\n(AHP). Use sparingly with children under 2 years; may irritate mouth or stomach if used too\\nliberally (WAM). Then there is Miller and Murray’s extremely cautious, but not critical review\\n(MAM). Though possibly “useful for mild hypertension ... routine use is not recommended.”\\nAfter informing us that no drug-drug interactions have been reported for garlic, they provide a\\nlong list of potential drug-drug interactions. Hasty readers, especially MDs, will take this as\\nproven drug-garlic interactions, “Avoid concomitant use ... with NSAIDS, anticoagulants, and\\nG\\ndrugs that inhibit liver metabolism (e.g., cimetidine (Tagamet), ciproflaxin (Cipro), clarithro-\\nmycin, diltiazem (Cardizem), enoxacin, erythromycin, fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, itra-\\nconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, paroxetine (Paxil), ritonavir) may at least additively and\\nperhaps synergistically interact with garlic.” (MAM) Watch also with drugs extensively metab-\\nolized by the liver (alprazolam, amitriptyline, astemizole, carbamazepine, cisapride, clozapine,\\ncorticosteroids, cyclosporine, desipramine, diazepan (Valium), imipramine, phenytoin (Dilan-\\ntin), propranolol, terfenadine (Seldane), theophylline, triazolam, warfarin (Coumadin), and\\ndrugs that may be affected by liver inhibition (e.g., propranolol, diazepam) (MAM). MAM\\ntabulates allergic contact dermatosis, burning GI sensations, diaphoresis, diarrhea, light-head-\\nedness, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, nausea, spinal epidural hematoma, and vomiting as side\\neffects of garlic (MAM). MAM even tries to attribute a case of spinal hematoma to garlic (in\\nan 87-year-old man ingesting 2 g daily “to prevent heart disease”). Perhaps they are too eager\\nto accentuate the negative, attributing the problem “to garlic’s ability to inhibit normal platelet\\nfunction.” Still accentuating the negative MAM talk about rats given massive doses (50 mg/day\\ngarlic powder) developing degenerative changes in 45 days and severe testicular lesions after\\n70 days (MAM). The credibility of their uncritical data is questionable; for example, on page\\n144, they talk about 0.75 mg garlic EO divided in three doses a day causing anorexia, nausea,\\nsevere vomiting, diarrhea, marked weight loss, metrorrhagia, and menorrhagia, yet on page 145\\nthey casually discuss a dosage more than three orders of magnitude higher for 20 days, lowering\\nplatelet aggregation from 30.37% to 21.21% (MAM). At 3 × 300 mg/day coated garlic powder\\ntablet, GI discomfort was the most frequent side effect; also bloating, dizziness, headache,\\nhypotensive circulatory reactions, outbreaks of sweating; daily doses of 900–1200 mg were\\nassociated with garlic odor.\\nExtracts (Garlic) — Extracts >30 ml/kg orl ipr scu in mus rat. Active hypoglycemic compounds\\nmay have insulin-sparing activity, the thiol groups competing for insulin with the inactivating\\ncompounds (PNC).

Perhaps erring on the side of caution,\\nReichert cautions that ginger may raise the blood pressure, may amplify blood-thinning drug activities,\\nand might be contraindicated in pregnancy. Contraindicated in childhood fevers and gallstones\\n(WAM). Patients with gallstones should consult a practitioner before taking ginger (AHP). The\\nLawrence Review says overdoses may cause cardiac arrhythmias and CNS depression (LRNP, Novem-\\nber 1991). Large doses (6 g or more) possibly gastroirritant, causing a significant increase in exfoliation\\nof gastric surface epithelial cells in human volunteers (MAB). Due to ginger’s strong antiaggregant G\\nactivity, experts recommend it not be used by people with blood clotting disorders. Many chemother-\\napy patients experience periods when their blood platelet counts drop dramatically. Doctors will warn\\npatients to avoid aspirin when their platelet counts are low. They feel that patients should also avoid\\nginger when their platelet count drops, while continuing use of ginger for patients with normal platelet\\ncounts. Less conservatively, Commission E reports rhizome should not be used for vomiting in\\npregnancy (AEH). Lininger et al. (1998) adds heartburn as a rare side effect. “A doctor should be\\ninformed if ginger is used before surgery to counteract possible postanesthesia nausea” (SKY).\\nExtracts (Ginger) — Fresh ginger juice reduces serum glucose levels in experimental animals\\n(PED). Both fresh and dry rhizome suppress gastric contractions and reduce vomiting (PNC).\\nGingerols and shogaols are analgesic, antipyretic, antiprostaglandin, antiulcer, hepatoprotective,\\nand hypotensive (PNC). As carminatives, the EOs, oleoresins, and proteolytic enzymes stimulate\\ndigestion, helping combat the effects of overeating, improper chewing, or excessive motion. They\\nincrease gastric motility and neutralize acids and toxins in the digestive tract (PED). Gingerol\\nand 6-gingerol inhibit gastric ulceration in rats. I suspect there’s synergy at work in the antiulcer\\nphytochemicals in ginger. 6-Gingesulfonic acid is less pungent but more potent against ulcers\\nthan 6-gingerol or 6-shogaol (MAB). Oral spray dried ginger (500 mg/kg) or combinations ginger\\nand licorice extracts (1000 mg/kg), significantly prevented gastric mucosal damage induced by\\nethanol in rats. Pretreatment with these inhibited the reduction in the deep corpus mucin content\\ncaused by ethanol (MAB). As a powerful thromboxane-synthetase inhibitor and prostacyclin\\nagonist, ginger has potential as an antidepressant, in alcohol withdrawal and the complications\\nof liver damage, and in treating a side effect of alcoholism, impotence, in preventing aging penile\\nvascular changes. LD50 ginger oil = >5000 mg/kg orl rat (MAB), LDlo ginger extract = >2300\\nmg/kg orl mouse, equivalent to 75,000 mg/kg ginger (MAB). Ginger extract equal to aspirin in\\nantiedemic activity; 940 mg powdered ginger is more effective than 100 mg dimenhydrinate for\\nkinetosis (motion sickness); ginger is equal to metoclopramide for postoperative nausea and\\nvomiting (WHO). 8 Gingerol more potently inhibited the response to serotonin than the control\\ndrug, cocaine (MAB). Gingerols are more potent at inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis than\\nindomethacin (MAB). Ginger extract inhibited swelling as actively as aspirin (MAB).

(Commission E approves as a tonic “for invigoration and fortification in times of\\nfatigue and debility, for declining capacity for work and concentration, also during convalescence”\\n(KOM); reading that reinforces my contention, in my ginseng book, that carrots could do a lot of\\nthe same thing at less than 1% of the price. I still feel that much of the literature on ginseng and\\nsoy comes from selective publications of sponsored research, making them look undeservedly better\\nthan carrot and black beans, for example.)\\nDosages (Ginseng) — Tea 3–4 ×/day, 3–4 weeks (PH2); 0.33–0.66 g root 3 ×/day; 0.6–3.0 g root\\n1–3 ×/day, 3 weeks–3 months (AHP); 0.5–1 g root daily, 15–20 days (CAN); 1–2 g root/day (PH2);\\n1–9 g root (FAY); 1–10 g root/day (MAB); 0.4–0.8 g root/day, long term (CAN); 1–2 g Asian\\nroot/day (APA); 0.5 tsp dried Asian root/cup water 1–2 ×/day (APA); 1 tbsp fresh root (PED);\\n0.5–2 g dry root (WHO); 2 g dry root:10 ml alcohol/10 mg water (PED); 0.5–3 g dry root/day or\\n1–6 ml fluid extract (1:2) (KEB); 1–2 g dry root (KOM; PED); 0.5–1 g powdered root (PNC); 3–9\\ng powdered ginseng/day (AKT); 3 (550 mg) capsules 3 ×/day (Korean); 1–4 (250 mg) StX capsules\\n(5–9% ginsenosides) (APA); 100 mg StX (4–7% ginsenosides) 1–2 ×/day; 1 (535 mg) StX 2 ×/day\\n(Korean).\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Ginseng) — Class 2d. Contraindicated\\nfor high blood pressure (AHP). The ginseng monograph published in 1991 says “none known”\\nregarding contraindications, drug interactions, or side effects (KOM). Contraindicated in acute\\ninfections, asthma, and high blood pressure (KEB). High doses may aggravate or cause decreased\\nsexual function, dysmenorrhea, euphoria, headaches, high blood pressure, insomnia, irritability,\\nmorning diarrhea, palpitations, skin eruptions, and tremors (KEB). The worst and most erroneous\\nstudies of ginseng were reported in JAMA, which accepted no corrections from the herbal\\nindustry, trying to get the reports straight. “Most commonly reported side effects of ginseng\\nare nervousness and excitation, which usually diminish” (LRNP, September 1990). Foster (1996)\\nreports GI distress, overstimulation, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea. Though estrogenic side\\neffects are reported in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, “clinical studies have\\ndemonstrated that a standardized ginseng extract does not cause a change in male and female\\nhormonal status” (WHO). Avoid if hypertensive or pregnant. Possible insomnia, mastalgia,\\nvaginal bleeding, and insomnia. Contraindicated for patients with hyperkinesis, hysteria, mania,\\nschizophrenia, or those who are nervous or tense. Not to be taken with stimulants, including\\ncoffee, antipsychotic drugs, or during treatment with hormones. Use cautiously in cardiopathy,\\ndiabetes, high blood pressure, hypotension, and with all steroid therapy. In Russia, it is even\\nsuggested that healthy people under age 40 should not take ginseng, but that middle-aged people\\ncan take small doses on a regular basis (CAN). Because of hormonal activity, its use in pregnancy\\nand lactation is to be avoided (CAN). Caution with insulin, warfarin, phenylzine, and loop\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 335\\ndiuretics (PH2). “Three newborns were intoxicated after an intake of 0.3–0.6 g ginseng decoc-\\ntion; one died” (Oriental studies translated by AHP.). Blumenthal suggests it may potentiate\\nMAOIs (MAB). Use should be restricted to 3 months (SHT). “It has been found to increase\\ncounts of total lymphocytes, T-Helper cells, and T4 and T8 subsets, and to improve NKC\\nactivity.” Positive as all this sounds, O’Brien cautions that headaches may result from chronic\\nuse. Do not take with digitalis (O’Brien, 1998).\\nExtracts (Ginseng) — Ginsenosides stimulate insulin release and increase insulin receptors to\\nexert a hypoglycemic response” (PH2). Root LD50 = 2000 mg/kg orl mouse (CAN); root LD50\\n= >5000 mg/kg orl mouse (CAN); LD50 (mixed saponins) = 500–900 mg/kg ipr mouse; 367 mg/kg\\nivn mouse; >5000 mg/kg orl mouse (HH2). CAN probably devotes more pages (pp.145–149) to\\nthe pharmacological effects of ginseng than the other herbs they treat more cursorily, “many of the\\npharmacological actions documented for ginseng directly oppose one another (hardly my usual\\nsynergy (JAD)) and this has been attributed to the actions of the individual ginsenosides. For G\\nexample, ginsenoside Rb1 exhibits CNS-depressant, hypotensive and tranquilizing actions; while\\nginsenoside Rg1 exhibits CNS-stimulant, hypertensive, and antifatigue actions. These opposing\\nactions are thought to explain the ‘adaptogenic’ reputation of ginseng, that is the ability to increase\\nthe overall resistance of the body to stress and to balance bodily functions.” PH2 states it even\\nmore narrowly, “A single ginsenoside may initiate multiple or opposing actions in the same tissue”\\n(PH2). My speculation is even stronger. The homeostatic human body is able to selectively sequester\\nneeded compounds from the homeostatic plant and, to an extent, exclude the unneeded compounds.\\nThus the hypotensive human who coevolved with ginseng might selectively use the needed hyper-\\ntensive ginsenoside, while the hypertensive human might adaptogenically sequester the hypotensive\\nginsenoside. Something for whatever ails you. Remember, this herb, like all herbs contains all the\\ncompounds essential for plant life, and many of those essential for human life. Carrots are consid-\\nerably cheaper.\\nGLORY-LILY (Gloriosa superba L.) X\\nSynonym — Clinostylis speciosa Hochst., Gloriosa abyssinica A.

Fresh plant may\\nirritate the mucosa (AHP). Not approved (KOM; PH2). “Goldenseal should not be taken for long\\nperiods of time” (Barney, 1996). The LRNP (June 1987) is a bit stronger, saying large doses of the\\nplant may irritate the mouth and throat, and cause diarrhea, nausea, parasthesia, and vomiting.\\n“CNS stimulation and respiratory failure induced by the plant can be fatal.” In higher doses\\nhydrastine can cause convulsions, exaggerated reflexes, high blood pressure, and death from res-\\npiratory failure (LRNP, but quoting an old, old book). No recent reports of toxicity in the literature\\n(SF). May alter intestinal flora. Canadian regulations do not allow it as an ingredient in oral products\\n(Michols, 1995). Contraindicated in glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency. Berberine may\\nantagonize heparin’s anticoagulant activity (PH2). The PDR last couplet in the PDR general warning\\nmay stimulate more sales, “If taken over an extended period, the drug can bring about digestive\\ndisorders, mucous membrane irritation, constipation, excitatory states, hallucinations, and occa-\\nsional deliria” (PH2). The potentially poisonous berberine may cause gastric upset (CAN). Because\\nG\\nof alkaloids with uterine stimulant activity, in vitro, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be\\navoided (CAN). Berberine is reportedly mutagenic in yeast cells and Ames test (intercalation into\\nthe DNA). PH2 assigns the toxicity more to hydrastine than to berberine, perhaps making barberry\\nand oregon grape look like safer alternatives, with the benefit of the MDR-inhibitor methoxyhyd-\\nnocarpine. “The hydrastine component appears to be the toxic component in goldenseal” (PH2).\\nOverdoses may induce bradycardia, central paralysis, and dyspnea (PH2). Death from berberine\\nhas been reported (MAB).\\nExtracts (Goldenseal) — LD50 goldenseal extract 1620 mg/kg orl mouse (MAB). A good source\\nof the COX-2 inhibitor, berberine (COX; FNF). See FNF for individual alkaloids activities, ber-\\nberine alone having close to fifty. Berberine from Hydrastis active against MDR strains of tuber-\\nculosis; also inhibits Helicobacter (PH2). Berberine more effective than sulfacetamide with Chlamy-\\ndia trachomatis from the eye (PH2).

LRNP (December 1988) says\\nthat, despite claims of nonallergenicity, dermatosis has been reported in some patients taking gotu\\nkola. Asiaticoside may be carcinogenic to the skin, following repeated applications (MB). Reading\\ntheir account, I’d not be any more afraid of gotu kola than wild lettuce. Contraindicated in epilepsy\\nand pregnancy; may photosensitize (MB). CAN cautions against dermatosis and phototoxicity.\\nIngestion may induce pruritus (CAN). Because it is reputed to be abortifacient and to affect the\\nmenstrual cycle, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. May interact with other blood\\npressure, cholesterol, and depression medications. “Excessive ingestion of hydrocotyle should be\\navoided” (CAN). Not allowed as nonmedicinal ingredient in oral use products in Canada. (Michols,\\n1995). Nausea may rarely follow extremely high doses (SKY).\\nExtracts (Gotu Kola) — With antiedemic and antiinflammatory activity, the triterpenoids promote\\nhealing and keratinization, stimulating the epidermis (asiaticoside may inhibit the synthesis of\\ncollagen and mucopolysaccharides in connective tissue). Hydroethanolic extracts showed anticon-\\nvulsant (40, 50, 60 mg/kg orl mouse), anxiolytic (75 mg/kg orl rats cf 2 mg diazepam ipr rat), and\\nsedative effects (75, 150, 300 mg/kg orl mouse), but no conclusive anorective effect.

One woman who consumed the\\nequivalent of 65 g tea leaves/day for 5 years exhibited liver dysfunction. Ascites and splenom-\\negaly resolved after tea was discontinued (SHT). Pedersen, who does not cover conventional\\ntea, says that peppermint leaf contains much astringent tannin, which can damage the liver\\nand intestine with prolonged use (Pedersen, 1998). Since the more widely used tea (Camellia\\nsinensis) often contains twice as much tannin as peppermint, this recommendation should be\\ndoubly pertinent under tea, or maybe we should call these tannins by the more attractive names\\n“OPCs, polyphenols, and pycnogenols” and declare them useful antioxidant good guys instead\\nof hepatotoxic bad guys (JAD). Regarding caffeine, “Pregnant women should under no cir-\\ncumstances exceed a dosage of 300 mg/day (5 cups of tea spread out over the course of a\\nday). Infants whose nursing mothers consume beverage containing caffeine could suffer from\\nsleep disorders” (APA).\\nExtracts (Green or Black Tea) — Both the polphenols (OPCs, tannins) and xanthines (caffeine)\\nhave their good and bad sides. As a major source of the major COX-2 Inhibitor ([+]-catechin),\\nthis might be viewed by enthusiasts as another herbal miracle aspirin (COX). See FNF. Muroi\\nand Kubo (1993) demonstrated synergies for antibacterial activity in compounds from tea (Camel-\\nlia sinensis), “... green tea extract is effective in the prevention of dental caries because of the\\nantibacterial activity of flavor compounds together with the antiplaque activity of polyphenols....\\nSynergism was found in the combination of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (delta-cadinene and\\nbeta-caryophyllene) with indole; their bactericidal activities increased from 128-fold to 256-\\nfold ... the combination of 25 µg/mL delta-cadinene and 400 µg/mL indole reduced the number\\nof viable (bacterial) cells at any stage of growth.” Translation: The mixture (“herbal shotgun”)\\nof three bactericidal compounds that might help prevent plaque was more than 100 times more\\npotent than the isolated individual compounds (“magic bullet”).

In view\\nof the lack of toxicity data and the reported cytotoxic activity of ursolic acid, excessive use of\\nground ivy should be avoided (CAN). But, all plants contain cytotoxic compounds and many, if\\nnot most, contain ursolic acid (JAD). Pulegone is an irritant, hepatotoxic, and abortifacient\\nprinciple.

C. oxyacantha L. var.\\npraecox hort. ex Loudon.\\nTaxonomic Quagmire: A subset of American advocates of phytomedicine argue that we should\\nemulate the Standard of Excellence of the German Commission E. Which one? Two came out in\\n1998, purporting to be authentic English presentations of the Commission E conclusions. Blumen-\\nthal’s very careful book (KOM in my HDR) approves only “hawthorn leaf with flower” (defining\\nhawthorn as dried flowering twig tips of C. laevigata or C. monogyna, or other members of the\\ngenus) and only for “decreasing cardiac output as described in functional Stage II of NYHA.” The\\nother, edited by Joerg Gruenwald, also an editor of Blumenthal’s Book, in his Herbal PDR (PHR)\\napproves Crataegus species (not specifying either C. laevigata or C. monogyna), “white thorn\\nflowers, leaves, fruit, and various mixtures of plant parts” for the same indication. My interpretation;\\nthese two and a few other species of the huge and taxonomically difficult Crataegus genus which\\ncontains some 200–300 species. But then we had sequelae to these first two volumes. In 2000,\\nBlumenthal et al. (BGB) say that “hawthorn refers to the fruit, leaf, and/or flower of the genus\\nCrataegus (usually C. laevigata syn. C. oxyacantha) and C. monogyna.” That can be interpreted\\nat least two ways, but I take it to mean both species. I refer those interested in the German gyrations\\ninvolved to the BGB. Conversely, Gruenwald in his Edition 2 (PH2) narrows his definition,\\nmentioning only English hawthorn, which the Herbal PDR Edition 2 equate to Crataegus laevigata,\\nwith no discussion of the distinction between the species. I frankly doubt that the writers of these\\nGermanic gyrations can tell the difference between species of hawthorn, especially after they have\\nbeen reduced to powders or tinctures. I doubt that Gruenwald, nor anyone else, can prove that these\\nresearches were done on C. laevigata. In citing my CRC Handbook (Duke, 1985), Gruenwald cites\\nan entry that was referred to C. oxyacantha. But I too, in 1985, was no surer of Crataegus taxonomy\\nthan I am today, hence, they are combined.\\nActivities (Hawthorn) — Antiaggregant (1; PNC); Antianginal (1; CAN; SKY); Antiarrhythmic\\n(2; CAN; MAB; PH2); Antiatherosclerotic (1; MAB); Anticapillary Fragility (1; FNF; MAB;\\nPH2); Antiedemic (1; PNC); Antiinflammatory (1; COX; MAB; PH2; WAM); Antioxidant (1;\\nCAN; MAB; PH2; SKY); Antisclerotic (1; PNC); Antiseborrheic (f; MAB); Antithromboxane\\n(1; MAB); Astringent (1; MAB; CRC); Bitter (f; PED); cAMP-Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor (1;\\nMAB); Cardioprotective (1; MAB); Cardiotonic (2; APA; BGB; CRC; FAD; MAB; PH2; PNC;\\nWAM); CNS Depressant (1; CAN); Collagen-Sparing (1; MAB; PH2); Coronary Vasodilator (1;\\nFAD; PED; PH2); Cyanogenetic (1; CRC); Depurative (f; CRC); Digestive (f; PED); Diuretic\\n(1; APA; CRC); Fumitory (f; CRC); Hepatoprotective (1; MAB); Hypertensive (f; PED); Hypo-\\ncholesterolemic (1; APA; PH2); Hypoglycemic (1; APA); Hypotensive (1; BGB; CAN; FAD;\\n368 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nMAB; PH2); Hypotriglyceridemic (1; MAB); Myocardioprotectant (1; MAB); Negative Bath-\\nmotropic (2; KOM); Negative Chronotropic (1; PH2); Nervine (1; WAM); Pancreaprotective (1;\\nMAB); Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor (1; MAB; PH2); Positive Chronotropic (2; KOM); Positive\\nDromotropic (2; KOM); Positive Inotropic (2; KOM; PH2); Sedative (1; CAN; PHR; PH2; PNC);\\nStomachic (f; CRC); Tonic (f; CRC); Vasodilator (1; APA; BGB; CAN).\\nIndications (Hawthorn) — Acne (1; MAB); Alzheimer’s (1; COX); Anemia (1; MAB); Angina\\n(2; APA; FAD; FEL; PH2; SKY); Atherosclerosis (2; BGB; FAD; CRC; MAB; SKY); Arrhythmia\\n(2; APA; CAN; MAB; PH2; WAM); Arthrosis (1; COX; PH2); Bradycardia (1; BGB; PHR; PH2);\\nBuerger’s Disease (f; BGB; CAN); Cancer (1; COX); Capillary Fragility (1; FNF; MAB; PH2);\\nCardiopathy (2; MAB; PH2); Cardiovascular Insufficiency (2; CAN; SKY); Cor Pulmonale (1;\\nPH2); CVI (f; FEL); Dermatosis (1; WAM); Dropsy (f; CRC); Dyspnea (1; APA; CRC; MAB;\\nPNC); Edema (1; APA; PNC); Erythema (1; MAB); Fatigue (1; BGB); Gingivosis (1; WAM); Heart\\n(f; CRC); High Blood Pressure (2; BGB; CAN; CRC; FAD; MAB; PH2; SKY); High Cholesterol\\n(1; APA; MAB; PH2); Hyperactivity (1; WAM); Hypertrophy (f; CRC); Inflammation (1; COX;\\nH\\nMAB; PH2; WAM); Insomnia (1; APA; CAN; PHR; PH2; PNC); Ischemia (1; PH2); Low Blood\\nPressure (f; PED); Myocardiosis (f; CAN); Nephrosis (f; CRC; MAB); Nervousness (1; CAN;\\nPHR; PH2; PNC); Palpitation (1; APA); Seborrhea (1; MAB); Sore Throat (f; CRC; MAB); Stasis\\n(f; PH2); Stress (1; BGB; WAM); Swelling (1; PNC); Tachycardia (f; CAN; MAB); Valvular\\nInsufficiency (f; CRC); Water Retention (1; APA; CRC). Interpretations by both Blumenthal et al.\\nand Gruenwald et al. (1998) of Commission E are simple, and almost identical for a change, for\\ndecreasing cardiac output as described in functional Stage II of NYHA. Nothing more, nothing less.\\nDosages (Hawthorn) — 1 tsp (1.8 g) chopped leaf and/or flower 2–3 ×/day, for a few weeks (APA);\\n1.5–3.5 g dry flower, leaf, fruit/day (MAB); 4–5 g fruit/day (SKY); 2–6 tsp fresh fruit (PED); 1–3 g\\ndry fruit (PED); 0.3–1 g dry fruit, or in tea, 3 ×/day (CAN); 2 g dry fruit:10 ml alcohol/10 ml water\\n(PED); average daily dose (5 g) in 1-g increments or 160–900 mg extract (standardized to flavonoids\\nor procyanidins) in 3 doses (PH2); 0.5–1 ml liquid extract (PNC); 0.5–1 ml liquid extract (1:1 in 25%\\nethanol) 3 ×/day (CAN); 3–6 ml fluid leaf extract (1:2) (MAB); 3–7 ml fluid fruit extract (1:2) (MAB);\\n4–5 ml tincture 3 ×/day (SKY); 1 tsp tincture morning and night for several weeks (APA); 7.5–15\\nml leaf tincture (1:5) (MAB); 7.5–17.5 ml fruit tincture (1:5) (MAB); 1–2 ml herbal tincture (1:5 in\\n45% ethanol) 3 ×/day (CAN); 2–3 (450 mg) capsules (StX to contain 100 mg certified potency\\nhawthorn extract with a minimum of preferred 1.8 mg vitexins, including vitexin-2′′-O-rhamnoside,\\nsynergistically combined in a base of Hawthorn Berry powder) with a large glass of water (NH);\\n80–160 mg StX 3 ×/day; 80–500 mg StX 2–3 ×/day 2.2% bioflavonoids, or 18.75% OPCs (SKY).\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Hawthorn) — Class 1 (AHP). May potentiate\\ndigitalis (AHP) and other cardiac medicines (WAM). Can interfere with cardiac, hypertensive, and\\nhypotensive therapies. “Not suitable for self medication” (CAN). Contrast that with Lininger et al.,\\n“Hawthorn is extremely safe for long term use ... No known interactions with prescription cardiac\\nmedications or other drugs ... No known contraindications ... during pregnancy or lactation” (SKY).\\n“Hazards and/or side effects not known for proper therapeutic dosages” (PH2). Not for children\\nunder 12 years old (PH2). CAN cautions that because of uterine activity, in vivo and in vitro, its\\nuse in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. Not for use during first trimester of pregnancy\\n(PH2). LRNP (January 1994), admitting that low doses are usually devoid of adverse effects, says\\nthat high doses may induce hypotension (that can be good in hypertension) and sedation (which\\ncan be good in insomnia). Side effects reported include fatigue, nausea, rash, and sweating (CAN).\\nThe tyramine content might suggest avoidance of MAOIs. High dose may be arrhythmogenic,\\nhypotensive, sedative, tremorigenic, and vertigogenic (PH2). Still, in combination with beta-block-\\ners “may cause a hypertensive effect” (PH2). May potentiate other cardiac drugs! Here’s a specu-\\nlative template that could double the size of any nitpickological compilation, “Herbs with this\\nactivity (and count the activities in my compilation) may or may not potentiate pharmaceuticals\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 369\\nwith the same activity.” The presence of ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers,\\nand diuretics makes this herb a safer offering in my book, than the four separate pharmaceuticals\\nbelonging to those A, B, C, and D recommendations for cardiopathy. “Roots, leaves, and flowers\\nall contain cardioactive compounds (CRC). One paper cited in Mitchell and Rook notes that corneal\\nscratches with the thorns led to blindness in 88 of 132 Irish accidents. With cyanogenic and\\ncardioactive compounds, not to mention tannin, scattered throughout the plant, it should not be\\ntaken lightly” (CRC). The presence of oleanolic and ursolic acids (COX-2 inhibitors) may be\\nequally significant in Alzheimer’s disease, arthrosis, and cancer. With isolated guinea pig heart\\nmuscle, luteolin-7-glucoside increased coronary flow 186%, hyperoside 66%, and rutin 66% (PH2).\\nAll also demonstrated positive inotropic and negative chronotropic. I’m lucky enough to have a\\nbearing 4-seeded C. monosperma (oxymoron intended). When juiced, the fruits gelled almost\\ninstantaneously, suggesting a large quantity of anticancer pectin.\\nExtracts (Hawthorn) — Hawthorn extracts increase coronary flow, and reduce blood pressure and\\nperipheral resistance. Hypotensive action attributed to vasodilation. Extracts, via OPCs, have beta-\\nH\\nblocking activities, the more OPC, the more beta-blocking. Extracts administered to rabbits exhibit\\nprophylactic antiarrhythmic activities. Flower extracts induce mild CNS-depressant activities; e.g.,\\nincreased sleeping time and decreased motility. Extracts antioxidant and antiperoxidant (CAN).\\nThe hawthorn’s cardiotropic effect is caused by increased membrane permeability for calcium as\\nwell as the inhibition of phosphodiesterase with an increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations.\\nThis leads to increased coronary and myocardial circulatory perfusion and reduced peripheral\\nvascular resistance (PHR). Lininger et al. say that it “may” improve coronary artery blood flow\\nand contractions of the heart muscle. It “may” inhibit ACE, and reduce production of angiotensin\\nII (SKY). Japanese clinical trials of 80 patients given fruits and leaves show clinical improvement\\nin cardiac function, dyspnea, and edema (PNC). German clinical studies of 60 patients with stable\\nangina receiving 60 mg hawthorn 3 ×/day showed increased coronary perfusion and economized\\nmyocardial oxygen consumption (CAN). Isolated constituents (mainly flavonoids) have LD50’s of\\n50–2600 mg/kg ivn, 6000 mg/kg orl in animals (CAN). Oral toxicity of hawthorn 6000 mg/kg\\norally (MAB). At 900 mg/day, hawthorn extract compared favorably with Captopril (37.5 mg/day)\\nin treating patients with Stage II cardiac insufficiency (BGB).\\nHEART OF JESUS (Caladium bicolor (Aiton) Vent.) +\\nSynonyms: Arum bicolor Aiton, Caladium x hortulanum Birdsey.\\nActivities (Heart of Jesus) — Antiseptic (f; CRC); Ascaricide (f; CRC); Emetic (f; CRC); Insec-\\nticide (f; CRC); Larvicide (f; CRC); Laxative (f; CRC).\\nIndications (Heart of Jesus) — Angina (f; CRC); Ascaris (f; CRC); Catarrh (f; CRC); Constipation\\n(f; CRC); Sore (f; CRC); Sore Throat (f; CRC); Splinter (f; CRC); Toothache (f; CRC); Wound (f;\\nCRC).\\nDosages (Heart of Jesus) — Food farmacy???

Oleo-resin reported to be allergenic, possibly causes dermatosis (CAN). Respi-\\nratory allergy caused by handling of hop cones (fresh hops oil, humulone, lupulone, and myrcene\\nproduce positive skin patch tests). Pollen can cause contact dermatosis. They suggest that hops\\nbe contraindicated in depressive states as the sedative effect of hops may aggravate or accentuate\\nsymptoms. “The sedative effect may potentiate the effects of existing sedative therapy and\\nalcohol” (CAN). In vitro antispasmodic activity on the uterus has been documented.

The bitter acids exhibit antifungal activity against Candida,\\nFusarium, Mucor, and Trichophyton. The flavanones are antistaphylococcic and antifungal\\n(Mucor and Trichophyton). Hops sedative and hypnotic, and motility-depressant properties are\\nattributed to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. Isovaleric acid may contribute to the sedativity. Hops report-\\nedly contain several sedative, analgesic, anesthetic, and anodyne compounds as well. Piperidine,\\nquercitrin, and ursolic acid may depress the CNS. Hops improve human sleep performance in\\ncombination with valerian and the hops are apparently effective in baths (I’d suggest in combi-\\nnation with dilute lavender and lemonbalm).

Seeds\\n“poisonous” and must be specifically prepared before being used medicinally. Never consume them\\nin any form unless a knowledgeable manufacturer has processed them properly. Children have died\\nafter ingesting untreated seed. Formerly an FDA herb of undefined safety. Strangely, APA gives the\\ninternal usage their highest rating (1) and external usage less (3) (APA). Aesculin has caused contact\\ndermatosis. The no-toxic-effect dose is ca. 8 times the recommended therapeutic dose. The results\\nH\\nof animal studies are corroborated by decades of use in patients with no reports of harmful effects\\ndue to overdosing. Tests for chronic toxicity (34 weeks in rats and dogs) showed no cumulative\\ntoxic effects or any evidence of embryotoxic or teratogenic effects. Isolated cases of GI distress,\\nitch, and nausea are reported (SHT). Commission E reports rare GI disturbances (AEH). No con-\\ntraindications or drug-drug interactions reported (PIP). Isolated cases of renal and hepatic toxicity\\nas well as anaphylactic reactions have been reported following intravenous administration, but these\\nappear to be exceptional (VET Herbs of Choice). Fleming (Herbal PDR, 1998) cautions that the\\nintake of too many horse chestnut seed (in one case, a child with 5 seed) can cause diarrhea, disorders\\nof consciousness and vision, enlargement of the pupils, flushing of the face, severe thirst, and\\nvomiting. In case of poisoning, Fleming recommends evacuation of the stomach and intestine (gastric\\nlavage, sodium sulphate) and administration of activated charcoal. Then symptom management\\n(PHR). Blumenthal et al. (1998) caution that other prescribed noninvasive treatments; e.g., leg\\ncompresses, support stockings, or cold water applications, must be observed under all circumstances\\n(KOM). CAN cautions that aescin is nephrotoxic. Side effects include GI disturbance, impaired liver\\nfunction, mild nausea, shock, spasm, urticaria, and vomiting. Should be avoided by patients on\\nblood-thinning therapy, with hepatic or renal impairment, or lactating or pregnant. Large doses of\\nsaponins can be fatally hemolytic in animals. LD50s range for aescin from 134 to 720 orally in\\nmice, rats, and guinea pigs. On ipr administration, the total saponin fraction (LD50 = 46.5 mg/kg\\nipr mouse) was less toxic compared to isolated aescin (LD50 = 9.5 mg/kg ipr mouse) (CAN).

In\\naddition, an extract excluding aescin also exhibited antiinflammatory activity suggesting antiin-\\nflammatory agents other than aescin (CAN). Aescin (the 13% mixture of saponins) may affect the\\ninitial phase of inflammation by reducing the number and/or diameter of capillary pores effectively\\nsealing the capillaries (CAN). It antagonizes effects of bradykinin but is not a direct bradykinin\\nantagonist (PNC). Barringtogenol-C-21 and hippocaesculin have in vitro antitumor activity (PNC).\\nClinical treatment of 15 varicose patients with 900 mg/day STX for 12 days reduced activity of\\nenzymes that breakdown proteoglycans (CAN).

Not to be\\nused by pregnant women (WAM).\\nExtracts (Hyssop) — Hyssop oil is powerfully neurotoxic, there have been several cases of\\nepileptiform seizures. Hyssop is a convulsant because of its pinocamphone (40%) and iso-pinocam-\\nphone (30%) content; this toxicity often refers to injections. At levels of 2.5 mg/kg, injections into\\nH\\ndogs produced almost immediate epileptiform seizures. With rats it took more than 130 mg/kg.\\nIntraperitoneal pinocamphone was a convulsant and lethal to rats at levels higher than 0.05 ml/kg.\\n“Even dermal administration of hyssop oil should be avoided in those vulnerable to seizures”\\n(Tisserand, 1995). Some EOs may be hazardous to people with epilepsy, especially those EOs that\\nare rich in artemisia ketone, camphor, pinocamphone, pulegone, and thujone. Some scientists\\nconsider ketones in general to be highly stimulant to the CNS, and hence are contraindicated for\\npeople with epilepsy (Tisserand, 1995). According to the Lawrence Review on Natural Products\\n(September 1996), hyssop, an ingredient in cold and cough preparations, appears to exert its\\ndemulcent and expectorant effects via its EO. However, injections of the oil may be convulsant\\nand neurotoxic at 130 mg/kg, and a rodenticide at 1250 mg/kg, probably due to isopinocamphone\\nand pinocamphone. Pinocamphone may be present at quantities as high as 13,000 ppm, isopinocam-\\nphone at 6500 ppm. Intraperitoneal injections from 4 ml/kg to 200 ml/kg produce a generalized\\ncrisis in rats leading from CNS convulsions to death. Anti-HIV and antiviral activities need to be\\nconfirmed (LRNP, September 1996). Oral administration of the oil can also be dangerous. Three\\ncases of clonic spasms have been reported, two adults each taking 10–30 drops each pure EO, and\\na 6-year-old child taking 2–3 drops a day over several days (KOM). Remember, I council in all\\ncases against pure EO. Diosmin and ursolic acid are antiinflammatory, the latter a COX-2 inhibitor.\\nAs the best source of diosmin, it could well be a very useful herbal tea for varicose veins. On a\\ndry weight basis, it can attain 6% diosmin. Dry hyssop of that strength would only take 10 grams\\nto provide the 600 mg diosmin considered antiinflammatory and capillary-protective. That’s why\\nI have it in my CapillADE. The activities of diosmin suggest that it might be most useful in several\\nconditions, diabetic retinopathy, edema, hemorrhoid, hyperglycemia, inflammation, and varicosities,\\nespecially in concert with OPCs and the related rutin.\\nI\\nIBOGA (Tabernanthe iboga Baill.)

Two seeds have been\\nenough to kill children (PH2), three to kill a horse (UPW). Abrin, the lectin, can cause coma,\\nconfusion, convulsions, dehydration, gastroenterosis, and hypotension (BRU). Aqueous seed extract\\nis abortifacient; LD100 2 mg/kg ipr mouse (MPI), LD40 = 25 mg/kg orl mouse (MPI). If the leaves\\nJ\\nreally contain a reported 10% glycyrrhizin, and a bigger if, no toxins, they might share many of\\nthe biological activities of licorice. One study (Choi et al., 1989) found no glycyrrhizin, rather four\\nabrusosides and three other sweet glycosides based on the novel cycloartane-type aglycon. Purified\\nabrusosides may prove useful as commercial sweeteners and lack the toxicity known in glycyrrhizin.\\nMore extensive toxicity tests need to be conducted (ZUL). Enzymes in abrin inhibit protein\\nsynthesis, causing cell death, more so in tumor than in healthy cells (ZUL).\\nJEWELWEED (Impatiens capensis Meerb.) +\\nSynonyms: I. biflora Walter and I. pallida Nutt. are considered synonyms by yours truly.\\nRegrettably, PH2 says, not too intelligently, “Impatiens is common in the temperate regions and\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 425\\nin South Africa, but grows mostly in the mountainous regions of Asia and Africa.” That makes\\nme think they are talking more of I. balsamina, but their monograph is labeled I. biflora, and\\nrefers to jewelweed, an American species. They cite only two German references, the same two\\nthey cite in their first edition PHR. Much of the confusion may hark back to EFS who rather\\n“lump” I. aurea, I. balsamina, I. biflora, and I. nolitangere. I suspect they all contain lawsone,\\nwhich makes them rather generic medicinally. For the moment I am reluctant to aggregate the\\ndata on the garden ornamental, I. balsamina, and my lovely wild flowers here in Maryland, the\\norange and the yellow jewelweed.\\nActivities (Jewelweed) — Analgesic (1; FNF); Antibacterial (1; FNF); Antihistaminic (1; CEB;\\nFNF); Antiinflammatory (1; FNF); Antipyretic (1; FNF); Antiseptic (1; FNF); Antisarcomic (1;\\nFNF); Antisickling (1; FNF); Antispasmodic (1; FNF); Antitumor (1; FNF); Aperitif (f; PH2);\\nDigestive (f; PHR; PH2); Diuretic (f; APA; DEM; PHR; PH2); Emetic (f; CEB); Emmenagogue\\n(1; FNF); Fungicide (1; APA; FNF); Laxative (f; CEB); Oxytocic (1; FNF); Uterotonic (1; FNF).\\nIndications (Jewelweed) — Anorexia (f; PH2); Asthma (f; CEB); Bacteria (1; FNF); Bruise\\n(1; APA; CEB; DEM; FAD; FNF); Bug Bite (1; FAD; FNF); Burn (1; APA; DEM; FAD; FNF);\\nCancer (1; FNF; JLH); Childbirth (f; DEM); Cold (f; CEB); Constipation (f; APA; CEB); Corn\\n(f; JLH); Cramp (f; DEM; FNF); Cut (1; FAD; FNF); Dermatosis (1; DEM; FNF); Dropsy (f;\\nCEB; DEM); Dyspepsia (f; PHR; PH2); Dysuria (f; DEM); Eczema (1; DEM; FAD; FNF); J\\nEyelid (f; DEM); Fever (1; FNF); Fungus (1; APA; CEB; FNF); Gastrosis (f; DEM); Headache\\n(f; DEM); Hemorrhoid (f; APA; CEB; PH2); Hepatosis (f; APA); Hive (1 DEM; FNF); Infection\\n(1; APA; FNF); Inflammation (1; FNF); Itch (1; APA; FNF); Jaundice (f; CEB; DEM); Liver\\nSpot (f; DEM); Mycosis (1; APA; FNF); Nephrosis (f; DEM); Pain (1; FNF); Poison Ivy (1;\\nFNF); Rash (f; APA); Ringworm (1; APA; CEB; FAD; FNF); Sore (1; APA; DEM; FAD; FNF);\\nSprain (1; CEB; DEM; FAD; FNF); Swelling (f; APA); Tumor (1; FNF); Urticaria (1; DEM;\\nFNF); Wart (f; APA; CEB; FAD; JLH; PH2); Water Retention (f; APA; DEM; PHR; PH2);\\nWound (f; DEM).\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Jewelweed) — Not covered (AHP). “Hazards\\nand/or side effects not known for proper therapeutic dosages” (PH2) (but PH2 designates no specific\\nquantified dosage! JAD). The reported emmenagogue and oxytocic activities of lawsone dictate\\ncaution in pregnancy (JAD). Failing to dye my beard red with jewelweed extracts, I fear it was\\nonly my cosmetological ignorance. Much later (2000), I read in EFS (ca. 1957), speaking of\\nimpatiens, “The juice of the plants is used in combination with alum by the natives of tropical\\ncountries to dye their nails.”\\nJIAOGULAN (Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.)

Commission E reports contraindications: pregnancy, nephrosis; adverse effects: pro-\\nlonged use or overdosing may lead to renal damage. Other sources report contraindication: pyelitis\\n(AEH). CAN caution that the volatile oil can be abortifacient and irritant. Because it is reputed to\\nbe abortifacient and to affect the menstrual cycle, and because there is confusion of whether the\\noil is toxic, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. “Excessive doses of terpinen-4-ol\\nmay irritate the kidneys. External application of EO can cause burning, edema, erythema, and\\ninflammation with blisters” (CAN). Long-term use can cause hypocalemia. May also potentiate\\ndiuretics and hypglycemics (CAN). Overdose can cause hematuria, priapism, strangury, and uremic\\nconvulsions (MAD). “Canadian regulations do not allow juniper as a non-medicinal ingredient for\\noral use products” (Michols, 1995). “Herbs with diuretic properties, such as juniper and dandelion,\\ncan cause elevations in blood levels of lithium” (D’epiro, 1997). As an occasional gin imbiber, I\\nfound the following of interest, “Normally avoided during pregnancy, mainly because of the\\nnotorious reputation of gin, of which juniper is the main flavor ingredient” (PNC). Tisserand (1995),\\n432 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nafter reviewing the literature, claims to debunk the many authors (including Duke, 1985), cautioning\\nabout abortifacient activity of juniper oil. He speculates that they are clouded by the sabine juniper,\\nwhich apparently does have abortifacient activities. He found few references indicating abortifacient\\nactivity for juniper oil, and the references suggested that ethanolic and acetone extracts of juniper\\nberries have antifertility activity in rats. “It seems inconceivable that the juniper oil could be\\nresponsible for the reproductive toxicity noted above. There is no reason to regard juniper oil as\\nbeing hazardous in any way” (Tisserand, R., 1995). New perspectives on EO safety. (pp. 16–35 in\\nIJA, 1995. Aroma’95 - One body - one mind.

Contraindi-\\ncated for endogenous depression (AHP). Maximum tolerated doses for dogs was 60 mg/kg,\\nfor rats 320 mg/kg StX (70% kavapyrones). Perversely, if the authors didn’t misspeak, the\\ndogs tolerated 24 mg/kg/day. Of >4000 patients taking 105 mg/day StX (70% kavapyrones),\\n1.5% had objectionable side effects (allergy, dizziness, GI distress, and headache). At levels\\n100 times the therapeutic dose (roughly 13 liters kava beverage a day or 300–400 mg rhizome\\nper week) caused anorexia, ataxia, dyspnea, hair loss, red eyes, skin rash, visual problems,\\nand yellow skin. “There is no potential for physical or psychological dependency. Use should\\nnot exceed 3 months.” (AHP) Germans limit use to 1–3 months (AHP). Commission E reports\\ncontraindications: esophageal and gastrointestinal stenoses; adverse effects: allergic reactions\\n(rarely). Other sources report intestinal obstruction (AEH). Many reports suggest a yellowing\\nof the skin in chronic users. “Chronic ingestion may lead to ‘kawism’ characterized by dry,\\nflaking, discolored skin, and reddened eyes” (LRNP, May 1987). Persistent rumors suggest\\nthat overdoses can cause intoxication. Commission E warns against the concomitant use of\\nkava with barbituates, antidepressant medications, and CNS agents. Lactating or pregnant\\nwomen should not use kava (WAM). “Not permitted as a non-medicinal ingredient in oral use\\nproducts in Canada” (Michols, 1995). Abuse by Australian Aborigines suggest links to hema-\\nturia, infectious disease, neurological abnormalities, pulmonary hypotension, nephrosis, visual\\ndisturbances, ischemic heart disease, thrombosis, and sudden heart attacks (MAB). The fol-\\nlowing quote might scare abusers, as it should, “Full consciousness is maintained with even\\nfatal doses” (APA, quoting Weiss, 1988).\\nExtracts (Kava) — Increase GABA in the synaptic cleft by increasing GABA secretion and\\ninhibiting its reuptake (SHT). LD50 dihydrokavain = 920 mg/kg orl mouse (MAB), LD50\\ndihydromethysticin = 1050 mg/kg orl mouse (MAB), LD50 StX (70% kavalactones) = 16,000\\nmg/kg orl rat, 1800 mg/kg orl mouse, 370 mg/kg ipr rat, 380 mg/kg ipr mouse (MAB). This\\nindicates that the mix is safer than the individual lactone, at least orally in rats and mice\\n(MAB). Kava slows hyperactivity in mice, but not as much as antipsychotic drugs. When\\nchewed, the root produces numbness in the mouth similar to what one would experience with\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 439\\ncocaine and longer-lasting than what one would experience with benzocaines (APA). In a\\ntraditional Hawaiian remedy, leaves were chewed and given to anxious or restless children for\\nits calming effect, and to induce sleep. And for the old reprobates “kava tends to lower one’s\\ninterest in sexual activities.” ( = ) lactones are 10 times more anticonvulsant than mephenesin\\nagainst strychnine; the mixture of lactones was synergistic; the potency of the mix was equal\\nto that of pure dihydromethysticin; synergy more pronounced with oral than ivn administration;\\nlactones better absorbed in mix than as isolated silver bullets (MAB). Lactones = cocaine and\\nprocaine as analgesic and anesthetic; dihydromethysticin better than aspirin but inferior to\\nmorphine as analgesic (MAB).\\nKELP (Nereocystis luetkeana (Mert.)

Creams containing extracts\\nproven effective for cutaneous lesions of the Herpes simplex virus (antiviral activity confirmed in\\nvitro and via clinical trials). Aqueous extracts inhibit cell division of tumor cells; tannin-free extracts\\ninhibit protein synthesis in cell-free systems of rat liver (PNC). “Spirits of Melissa” demonstrated\\neffective in psychiatric disorders (dystonia, headache, hyperexcitability, palpitation, restlessness)\\n(PNC). Recent British studies indicate that extracts inhibit breakdown of acetylcholine in human\\nbrain cell cultures (Perry et al.). Constituents block attachment to thyroid cells of the antibodies\\nthat cause Graves disease; the brain’s signal to the thyroid (TSH) is blocked from further overstim-\\nL\\nulating the thyroid (SKY). Whole EO is more spasmolytic than isolated ingredients; neral and\\ngeranial is more spasmolytic than beta-caryophyllene or citronellal. EO is sedative in mice at 1\\nmg/kg, more so than at 3 mg/kg. Sedative effects kick in after 30–60 minutes and endure about an\\nhour (JAR10:7). Citronellol, beta-caryophyllene, and citronellal are active against Candida, Sta-\\nphylococcus, and Streptococcus (JAR10:7).\\nLEMON BUSH (Lippia javanica (Burm. f.)

As prolonged use/higher doses may\\ngive mineralcorticoid adverse effects/interactions, the root should not be used for more than 4–6\\nweeks without consulting a physician (PH2; WAM). Use as flavoring in doses providing no more\\nthan 100 mg of glycyrrhizin per day is also allowed (AEH; KOM). Cantelli-Forti et al. (1994) note\\nthat “serious side effects related to glycyrrhizin ingestion, including headaches, edema, body weight\\nincrease, and disturbances in body-electrolyte balance were observed either after daily high LE\\npersonal consumption or in clinical use.” “Continuous consumption of licorice root extract in daily\\nuse as food or for therapeutic purposes is safer than the use of glycyrrhizin alone (or when the\\nlatter is added to man-made products (chewing gums, drinks, drugs, sweets etc.)).” I would extend\\nthat into a generality for whole herbal extracts rather than silver bullets: “Continuous consumption\\nof whole plants or plant extracts is safer than the use of their major active ingredient alone (or\\npurified and added to drugs).” CAN cautions that excessive ingestion can cause hyperaldosteronism.\\nBecause of estrogenic activity and reputed abortifacient activity, its use in pregnancy and lactation\\nis to be avoided (CAN; WAM). “In India, licorice has been used as a sweetener, aphrodisiac,\\nemmenagogue, and galactagogue” (PED).\\nExtracts (Licorice) — Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits EBV activation by tumor promoters (CAN).\\nIsoflavonoids are antiseptic against bacteria, Candida, Mycobacterium, and Staphylococcus\\n(CAN); antiviral activity against Epstein-Barr, herpes, Newcastle, vaccinia, and vesicular\\nstomatosis virus with no activity toward polio (CAN). Isoliquiritigenin inhibits aldose reduc-\\ntase, the first enzyme in the polyol pathway wherein glucose is reduced to sorbitol. It inhibits\\nsorbitol accumulation in human red blood cells in vitro, and in red blood cells, the sciatic\\nL\\nnerve, and the lens of diabetic rats. Many diabetic complications (cataracts, nephropathy,\\nperipheral neuropathy, retinopathy) are associated with the polyol pathway and have shown\\nimprovement with aldose reductase inhibitors (CAN). Glycyrrhizin reduces morbidity and\\nmortality of mice infected with lethal doses of flu virus (TAD). Glycyrrhizin inhibits inflam-\\nmation and prostaglandin synthesis. Glycyrrhizin blocks estrogen effects binding to estrogen\\nreceptors, hence the antiestrogenic activities reported; estrogenic activity has also been attrib-\\nuted to the isoflavones, but these too may bind to estrogen receptors (CAN; JAD). Maybe this\\nis one of those amphoteric herbs. “Liquorice exhibits an alternative action on estrogen metab-\\nolism, causing inhibition if oestrogen concentrations are high and potentiation when concen-\\ntrations are low” (CAN). I’ve heard the same things about clover phytoestrogenic isoflavones,\\nsome of which are shared with licorice.

Glycyrrhizin not only has its own antiar-\\nthritic, antiedemic, and antiinflammatory activities, it potentiates the antiarthritic activities of\\nhydrocortisone, at least in rats (MPI). Licorice seems also to potentiate prednisolone in five\\npatients with pemphigus and kept free of bullae with prednisolone.

I’m not even keen on transdermal nicotine, but I find it perhaps\\nhealthier than smoking, and it doesn’t affect my neighbors with second-hand smoke. The alkaloid\\nlobeline can cause cough, diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, tremors, and vomiting (CAN).

At high doses vasicine protects against\\nhistamine-induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs. Its autooxidation product, vasicinone, had\\nbronchodilatory activity in vitro and in vivo, and relaxes the tracheal muscle in vitro. Vasicinone\\nis more potent than vasicine with antiasthmatic properties comparable to (NOTE: hype liter-\\nature often uses the word comparable to mean can be compared to, not necessarily meaning\\nequal to) disodium cromoglycate. Vasicinone is reportedly synergetic with vasicine on bron-\\nchodilation and ciliary movements. Their 1:1 mix is more bronchodilatory and antagonized\\nM\\nhistamine-induced bronchoconstriction than vasicine alone or theophylline. The cardiodepres-\\nsant effect activity of vasicine was normalized by vasicinone. Flowers contain the antiasthmatic\\nquercetin.\\nMALABAR TAMARIND\\n(Garcinia cambogia (Gaertn.)

Cannabis is fetotoxic.\\nExposure to cannabis in utero may cause a 10-fold increase in childhood leukemia risk. It can\\ntrigger acute psychotic reactions in schizophrenia, and increases risk of new schizophrenia 6-fold.\\nCannabis smoking impairs learning and short-term memory, persisting for perhaps several weeks.\\nCannabis has been implicated in many road accidents and some air and rail accidents (Doyle and\\nSpencer, 1995). “Hazards and/or side effects not known for proper therapeutic dosages” (PH2).\\nSmoking quickly leads to euphoria with exaggerated sensuality, with alterations in space and time\\nperception, and acoustical, sensory, and visual hallucinations, lasting 2–3 hours in higher doses.\\nAlthough rarely reported, there are occasional acute poisonings with symptoms including cardiop-\\nathy, hacking cough, lacrimation, nausea, numbness, and vomiting. Chronic abuse may lead to\\napathy, bronchosis, impotence, laryngitis, and psychic decline. Instances of death “are very rare”\\n(PHR). Smoking suppresses the luteinizing hormone in women.\\nExtracts (Marijuana) — The new Herbal PDR (Gruenwald, 1998) adduces animal or clinical\\nevidence for analgesic (“feeling no pain”), anticonvulsant, antiemetic, antiglaucomic, antistaphy-\\nlococcic, antistreptococcic, antitumor, bactericidal, bronchodilation, hypertensive and hypotensive,\\norexigenic, and vasodilating activities (PHR). PNC relates the antiinflammatory activity to inhibi-\\ntions with cyclo-oxygenase, lipoxygenase, and phospholipase A2. THC is not as effective an\\ninflammatory as cannabidiol and cannabigerol, olivetol, and some of the flavonoids (PNC). Anal-\\ngesic, cataleptic, and hypotensive activities confirmed in animals (PNC). 3,5,4'-trihydroxybibenzyl-\\nmethyl-ether is estrogenic (WO2). Caryophyllene on exposure rapidly converts to the epoxide,\\nwhich is responsible for recognition by police dogs. Maybe that’s why those dogs were after my\\nM bag in Peru when I came in from Belize. ( = ) THC seems as affective as prochlorperazine in\\nreducing chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting (APA).\\nMARITIME PINE (Pinus pinaster Aiton) ++\\nSynonym: Pinus maritima Lam.\\nActivities (Maritime Pine) — Analgesic (1; FNF); Antiaging (f; X9817994); Antiaggregant (1;\\nX10882879); Antiallergic (1; FNF; IJO16:204); Antiamyloid (1; X10864026); Antianaphylactic\\n(1; FNF); Antianemic (1; X10793299); Antiasthmatic (1; FNF; PJB1(2):279); Antiatherogenic\\n(1; FNF; PJB1(2):279); Antibacterial (1; FNF; PM56(6):577); Anticancer (1; X10953304); Anti-\\ndermatotic (1; X11180529); Antiedemic (1; FNF; APP16:50); Antiexudative (1; FNF; APP16:50);\\nAntihistaminic (1; FNF); Anti-HIV (1; FNF); Antiinflammatory (1; FNF; PR13:619); Antioxidant\\n(1; X11087530); Antiplaque (1; X10864026); Antiradicular (1; FNF); Antiseptic (1; FNF);\\nAntisickling (1; X10793299); Antithromboxane (1; X10882879); Antiviral (1; FNF); Apoptotic\\n(1; X10953304); Cancer Preventive (1; FNF; HG22:30); Capillaritonic (1; APP16:50); Hemopoi-\\netic (1; X9817994); Hyaluronidase Inhibitor (1; FNF; IJO16:204); Immunomodulator (1; FNF;\\nPR13:619); Lipolytic (1; FNF; PR13:619); Lipoxygenase Inhibitor (1; X11087530); NO-Genic\\n(1; X10631311); Peroxidase Inhibitor (1; X11087530); Retinoprotective (1; X11351356); Sun-\\nscreen (1; FNF); Xanthine-Oxidase Inhibitor (1; X11087530);\\nIndications (Maritime Pine) — ADD (1; X10517050); Allergy (1; FNF; IJO16:204); Alzheimer’s\\n(1; X10864026); Anaphylaxis (1; FNF); Anemia (1; X10793299); Asthma (1; FNF; PJB1(2):279);\\nAtherosclerosis (1; FNF; PJB1(2):279); Bacteria (1; FNF; PM56(6):577); Cancer (1; FNF;\\nHG22:30; X10953304); Capillary Fragility (1; APP16:50); Cardiopathy (1; FNF); CVI (1;\\nX11351356); Dementia (f; X9817994); Dermatosis (1; X11180529); Dysmenorrhea (1; FNF);\\nEdema (1; X11351356); Endometriosis (1; FNF); Enterosis (1; FNF); Gastrosis (1; FNF); HIV (1;\\nFNF); Hyperactivity (1; FNF; X105170500); Immunodepression (1; FNF; PR13:619); Infection\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 489\\n(1; FNF); Inflammation (1; FNF; PR13:619); Mastosis (1; X10953304); Obesity (1; FNF;\\nPR13:619); Pain (1; FNF); Retinosis (1; X11351356); Senility (f; X9817994); Sickle Cell (1;\\nX10793299) Swelling (1; FNF; APP16:50); Virus (1; FNF).\\nDosages (Maritime Pine) — Pinebark is eaten in survival situations, hence I call it Food Farmacy\\n(JAD); 60–100 mg bark extract/day, standardized for 95% pycnogenol (including proanthocyani-\\ndins, phenolics and flavonoids) (NH); 50 mg pycnogenol 3 ×/day for 2 months (X11351356).\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Maritime Pine) — Not covered (AHP; KOM;\\nPH2).

None known for herb, rare GI upsets\\nfor roots (KOM). Herbage contraindicated in fluid retention due to reduced cardiac or renal activity,\\nrarely causing allergic reactions (PHR). Adverse effects of root: mild GI complaints (occasionally)\\n(AEH). The urtication can be painful and long-lasting, in some inducing a black-and-blue reaction.\\nNo fatalities are reported in the U.S. CAN cautions that amines are irritant. Because it is reputed\\nto be abortifacient and to affect the menstrual cycle, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be\\navoided. May interfere with blood pressure, CNS, and diabetes medication (CAN). Being a nettle\\nfan, I had never heard of it before and was reluctant to try it when my friend Vic said that the root\\ntea almost did him in. It’s almost as though he read the book, “Consumption of nettle tea has caused\\ngastric irritation, a burning sensation of the skin, oedema, and oliguria” (CAN). Not for use in\\nseverely allergic patients, especially those with tendency toward anaphylaxis (WAM). Schulz et al.\\n(1998) report on >4000 patients taking 600–1200 mg extract/day for 6 months. Only 35 showed\\nside effects, 0.65% GI complaints, 9 (0.19%) dermatosis, and 2 (>0.05%) reporting hyperhydrosis\\n(SHT). No contraindications are stated (SHT). Varro Tyler cautions against self-medication with\\nBPH. Whenever treating BPH, a practitioner should be involved. Base-line levels of PSA should\\nbe established before considering an herbal treatment (JAD). Even JAMA admits that there is no\\nhard proof for any intervention in BPH. Since hospitals kill 200,000 Americans a year, and prostate\\ncancer fewer than 50,000, I’ll opt for nettle tea and sitosterol-rich nuts as the drug of choice for\\nprostate protection.\\nExtracts (Nettle) — Infusion LD50 = 1929 mg/kg ivn rat. HOH extract LD50 = 1721 mg/kg ivn\\nrat. The tea was well tolerated at levels of 1310 mg/kg orally (Bombardelli and Morazzoni, 1997).\\nLD50 infusion 1310 orl rat (MAB). (9Z-11E)-13-Hydroxy,9,11-octadecadienoic-acid, 14 octa-\\ncosanol, oleanolic acid, secoisolariciresinol, and ursolic acid are listed as weak to moderate aro-\\nmatase-inhibitors found in the methanolic root extract. Suggesting synergy, HH3 gives IC50’s for\\naromatase inhibition; extract: 338 µg/ml; aqueous extract = >200 µg/ml; butanolic fractions: 109\\nN\\nµg/ml; ethanolic-fraction 41 µg/ml; 9-hydroxy,10,12- octadecadienoic-acid = 11 µg/ml, and GLA,\\nthe compound is so well represented in another edible weed, evening primrose, at 10 µg/ml (HH3).\\nAromatase is a key enzyme in steroid hormone metabolism, and its inhibition may partially explain\\nthe activity of the roots in BPH. The polysaccharide fraction of the aqueous root extract show\\nprolonged antiedemic and antiinflammatory activity (40 mg/kg orl rat). Ethanolic extract also\\ninhibits elastase, a destructive enzyme in the inflammatory process (IC50=68 µg/ml). The isolectin\\n(UDA), abundant in the roots, may contribute to the antiinflammatory and antiprostatic activity of\\nthe extracts. Aqueous extracts interfere with, dose-dependently (0.6–10 mg/ml), the binding of\\ndihydrotestosterone to SHBG (with specific receptors on human prostatic membranes). The alco-\\nholic extract, UDA, and stigmast-4-en-3-one were inactive. At concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml, some\\nroot extracts inhibited Na+, K+-ATPases 27.6–81.5%. Stigmast-4-en-3-one, stigmasterol, and\\ncampesterol inhibited Na+, K+-ATPases 23–67% at concentrations of 1-1000 µM. Such inhibition\\nmay influence prostate cell metabolism and growth (Bombardelli and Morazzoni, 1997). Root\\npolysaccharide extracts anticomplementary (IC50=<50 µg/ml (HH3)). Strange that an herb should\\ninject so many neuroactive compounds, acetylcholine, choline, formic acid, histamine, leukotrienes,\\nand serotonin (PH2) into unsuspecting grazers.\\nNEW JERSEY TEA (Ceanothus americanus L.) ++\\nSynonyms: C. americanus var. intermedius (Pursh) Torr. & A.

Do not apply near nostrils of pediatrics, may cause asthma-like attacks, bronchial\\nspasm, glottal spasms, and even respiratory failure (KOM; PHR). Confusingly calling it caje\\nrather than niauli oil, and noting that it contains 35–60% cineole, Fleming et al. say that\\ncineole causes induction of enzymes involved in liver detoxification, thereby possibly short-\\nening or lessening the effects of other drugs that might have been coadministered. (I suppose\\nwe can say that about all aromatic plants that contain significant quantities of cineole, and\\nmany do; what level of cineole is significant?) As with most EOs, this one may induce\\ndermatosis in sensitive individuals. Fleming et al. even warn that overdosages (more than 10\\ng), can lead to life threatening poisonings, due to the cineole. Ten grams of niauli oil could\\ncontain 6 g cineole. Symptoms include circulatory disorders, collapse, fall in blood pressure,\\nand respiratory failure.

Contraindicated in\\nnephrosis (AHP). “Hazards and/or side effects not known for proper therapeutic dosages”\\n(PH2). Commission E approves the herb and root, not the seed (fruit) (KOM). CAN cautions\\nthat the apiole in the volatile oil and excessive ingestion can be abortifacient, irritant, photo-\\ntoxic, and cause hepatosis. In pregnancy and lactation, parsley should not be ingested exces-\\nsively (CAN). Myristicin can cause deafness, decrease in pulse rate, giddiness, hypotension,\\nand paralysis, followed by fatty degeneration of the kidney and liver. Myristicin may cross\\nP\\nthe placenta, leading to fetal tachycardia. Ingestion of 10 g apiole (200 g parsley) may cause\\nacute hemolytic anemia, hepatic dysfunction, nephrosis, and thrombocytopenia pupura (CAN).\\nParsley may potentiate MAOI activity (CAN). Because of its toxicity, EO should not be used\\nin isolation (KOM). Commission E is rather tough on parsley seed oil, but the indictment,\\noverblown or not, might conceivably be extended to other herbs containing apiole and myris-\\nticin. Of apiole, “Large doses of parsley-seed EO and of ... apiol bring about vascular congestion\\nand increased contractility of the smooth muscle of the bladder, intestines, and especially the\\nuterus. Parsley seed and oil are therefore often used to bring about abortion.” (BIS) The renal\\nepithelium can be damaged or irritated and cardiac arrhythmias can occur after using parsley\\nseed preparations (BIS). “Large doses of apiol can lead to fatty liver, emaciation, extensive\\nmucosal bleeding, and inflammatory haemorrhagic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract,\\nhaemoglobinuria, methaeglobinuria, and anuria. Therapeutic use cannot be endorsed” (Com-\\nmission E, as interpreted by Bisset, 1994). Commission E reports contraindications: pregnancy\\nand nephrosis; adverse effects: allergic reactions of skin/mucosae (rarely) and phototoxicity.\\nThe pure oil is toxic and should not be used. Fruit not permitted for therapeutic use. The EO\\nand its constituent apiole are toxic (AEH). When parsley is decocted it is emmenagogue and\\nabortive. A young woman, in 1992, reportedly died while trying to abort. “Even the common\\nparsley mentioned earlier can cause serious injuries; oedema of the legs, vomiting, haematuria,\\nliver and renal damage have all been observed. However, poisoning by this plant is never\\naccidental, but always voluntary, so the plant can be used safely in preparing food”\\n(FIT67(6):513. 1996).\\n556 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nExtracts (Parsley) — Water extracts are antihistaminic (CAN). EO = antiseptic, carminative,\\ndiuretic, emmenagogue, hepatoregenerative; hypotensive, increases plasma calcium (CAN; PED;\\nPNC). Phthalides are sedative in mice (PNC).

(1994) note that lapachol and beta-lapachone,\\nthough active against Candida, could be harmful. Multiple doses of oral lapachol at 500 mg/kg caused\\ndeath with severe histopathological changes. In clinical trials, oral lapachol induced anticoagulant\\neffects, nausea, and vomiting. After 6 doses at 9 mg/kg, beta-lapachone caused death, following\\nanorexia, diarrhea, and weight loss (LRNP, July 1990). Napthaquinones (lapachol and beta-lapachone)\\nhave antifungal properties comparable to ketoconazole (SKY). Beta-lapachone is a better antifungal\\nthan ketoconazole (MAB).

Leaf contains much astringent tannin that can damage\\nthe liver and intestine with prolonged use (PED). Commission E reports contraindications for EO:\\nbiliary obstruction or inflammation, and severe liver damage. Since the more widely used tea (Camellia\\nsinensis) often contains twice as much tannin as peppermint, this recommendation should be doubly\\npertinent under tea, or maybe we should name these tannins the more glamorous “OPCs, polyphenols,\\nand pycnogenols” and declare them antioxidant good guys instead of hepatotoxic bad guys (JAD).\\nRats receiving 100 mg/day peppermint oil develop dose-related brain lesions. Because of its ability\\n564 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nto relax GI smooth muscles, peppermint oil may sometimes worsen symptoms of hiatal hernia. Coated\\npills opening too soon (in stomach) may cause gastralgia and heartburn. Excessive ingestion of the\\noil is associated with acute renal failure and interstitial nephrosis. Menthol reactions include reported\\ncases of urticaria, allergic cheilitis, stomatosis, and rarely, shaking chills from use of topical menthol\\nproducts. GI complaints due to use of peppermint preparations include stomatosis, severe esophagitis,\\ngastrosis, unexplained diarrhea, and pancreatitis. Menthol in nasal preparations may cause spasm of\\nthe glottis in young children (AEH). Should not be inhaled by small children (AEH). Menthol-\\ncontaining ointments applied to an infant’s nostrils have produced immediate collapse. “Peppermint\\ntea should not be given to infants or very young children because the pungent fragrance can cause\\ngagging” (Castleman, 1996). Estimated LD for menthol in humans may be as low as 2 g. Survival\\nafter doses of 8 to 9 g have been reported. I fear APA erred in saying that it took 1 g/kg body weight\\nmenthol to be lethal in humans (APA). Estimated LD50 for peppermint oil in humans = 2000–9000\\nmg (2–9 g). Peppermint oil has an antispasmodic action on isolated segments of ileum (cats and\\nrabbits) at 50 ppm (dilutions no greater than 1:20,000).\\nExtracts (Peppermint) — Peppermint oil antagonizes the spasmogenic action of barium chloride,\\npilocarpine, and physostigmine. Antispasmodic action of peppermint oil is based on properties that\\nare characteristic of calcium antagonists. Peppermint oil acts competitively with nifedepine and\\nblocks Ca2+-exciting stimuli.

In sheep and guinea-pigs the plant, extracts, purified cardenolide,\\nand digoxin exhibited similar toxicity and gross pathology. In a 3 month toxicity study in rats,\\nasclepin was found safe in doses of 0.8, 8, and 20 mg/kg. Cat studies were less cumulative compared\\nto digoxin. Asclepin reportedly was stronger toward weak cardiac muscle.

It is interesting to see how Blumenthal et al. (1998) and Fleming et al.\\n(1998) separate two species of psyllium, one of which Blumenthal et al. call blonde, P. ovata, and\\nthe other black, P. psyllium (P. afra). I doubt that many botanists can tell all the plantain species\\napart, even in the field with flowers, fruits, and leaves present. I maintain that unvouchered studies\\non these closely related species are almost meaningless and the medical literature built on a\\nmountain of toothpicks. I have read that our local weed, the plantain, Plantago major, was at one\\ntime substituted, successfully for psyllium, but I doubt if the vouchers are there to back up that\\nstory either. I think that the husks and seeds of several species have been confused and share many\\nsimilar activities.\\nActivities (Psyllium) — Allergenic (1; APA); Antibacterial (f; WOI); Anticancer (1; HH2); Anti-\\ncholinergic (1; PNC); Antipyretic (f; KAB); Astringent (f; DEP; KAB); Cardiodepressant (1; PNC);\\nDemulcent (1; CAN; DEP; KAB; PED); Digestive (1; KAB); Diuretic (f; KAB; PED; WHO);\\nEmollient (f; DEP); Flatugenic (1; CAN); Hepatoprotective (1; PNC); Hypertensive (1; KAP);\\nP\\nHypocholesterolemic (1; BGB; HH2; KAB; KOM; LAF); Hypoglycemic (1; BGB; HH2; PNC);\\nHypotensive (1; KAP; PNC); Hypouricemic (1; HH2); Laxative (2; BGB; DEP; KAP; PNC);\\nPectiniferous (2; JAD); Peristaltic (2; PIP; PNC; WHO).\\nIndications (Psyllium) — Adenopathy (f; JLH; KAP; WHO); Atherosclerosis (f; SKY); Bacteria\\n(f; WOI); Bleeding (1; KAP); Blennorrhea (f; KAP); Cacoethes (f; JLH); Cancer (1; HH2; JLH);\\nCancer, breast (f; JLH); Cancer, colon (f; JLH); Cancer, ear (f; JLH); Cancer, intestine, (f; JLH);\\nCancer, liver (f; JLH); Cancer, mouth (f; JLH); Cancer, neck (f; JLH); Cancer, parotid (f; JLH);\\nCancer, throat (f; JLH); Cancer, uterus (f; JLH); Candida (1; PED); Cardiopathy (2; BGB); Catarrh\\n(f; DEP; KAP); Chelation, cyclamate (1; PNC); Cold (f; DEP); Colitis (2; BGB; KOM; PH2; SHT);\\nConstipation (2; BGB; DEP; KAP; KOM; PH2; PNC; SHT; WHO); Cough (1; DEP; PED; PH2);\\nCramp (1; APA); Cystosis (f; CAN; DEP; KAP); Dermatosis (f; CAN); Diabetes (1; APA; HH2;\\nPH2); Diarrhea (2; DEP; KOM; PH2; SKY; WHO); Diverticulosis (1; CAN; SHT); Duodenosis\\n(f; PH2); Dysentery (1; CAN; DEP; KAB; PH2); Dyspepsia (f; DEP); Dysuria (f; DEP; KAP;\\nPH2); Enterosis (1; APA; PH2); Fever (f; DEP; KAB); Furunculosis (f; CAN; PH2); Gallstone\\n(preventive) (1; BGB; PH2); Gas (f; PH2); Gastrosis (f; PH2); Gonorrhea (f; DEP; KAP; PH2);\\nGout (1; HH2; KAP; PH2; WHO); Hemorrhoid (2; DEP; KAP; KOM; PH2; SKY); Hepatosis (f;\\nJLH; PNC); High Blood Pressure (1; APA; KAP; PED; PNC); High Blood Sugar (1; PH2); High\\nCholesterol (2; BGB; HH2; KAB; KOM; LAF; PHR; PH2; SKY); High Triglycerides (1; PH2;\\nSKY); Hyperglycemia (1; BGB; HH2; PNC); IBS (1; APA; KOM; PH2; SKY); Inflammation (f;\\nDEP; KAP); Low Blood Pressure (1; KAP); Mastosis (f; JLH); Mucososis (2; DEP; KOM; PH2;\\n592 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nPIP); Nephrosis (f; DEP; KAP; PH2); Obesity (1; PH2; SKY); Pain (1; PH2); Parotosis (f; JLH);\\nPharyngosis (2; KOM; PIP); Pregnancy (1; APA); Proctosis (1; APA); Psoriasis (f; SKY); Respirosis\\n(2; BGB; KOM; PIP); Rheumatism (f; KAP; PH2); Sore (f; DEP); Stomatosis (f; JLH); Ulcer (f;\\nPH2); Ulcerative Colitis (1; PH2); Urethrosis (f; KAP).

Bulking agents should not be taken by those\\nwith stenotic lesions of the GI tract. May lead to bowel obstruction if fluid intake is inadequate.\\n(Take 150 ml water/5 g psyllium (KOM)). Do not take bulking agents when laying down or at\\nbedtime. Do not use with antiperistaltics (e.g., such as loperamide, for example) (SHT). Physi-\\ncians and other health care professionals are developing increasingly allergic reactions to psyllium\\npowder. There are reports of a fatal bronchospasm after oral ingestion of ispaghula, identical\\nwith, or closely related to psyllium. Commission E reports contraindications for seed and seed-\\nshell: GI obstruction (ileus), and diabetes, which is hard to control (as insulin need may be\\nreduced); adverse effects: allergic reactions; interactions: absorption of other drugs taken simul-\\ntaneously. Other contraindications: intestinal obstruction (AEH). Based on early drafts, AHP\\nrepeats that psyllium is contraindicated in “diabetes mellitus which is difficult to regulate ...”\\nThere may be a need to reduce insulin dosage in insulin-dependent diabetes (KOM). If swallowed\\ndry, psyllium can cause esophageal obstruction and flatulence (CAN). “Ispaghula husk depressed\\nthe growth of chickens by 15% when added to their diet at 2%.” By speeding transit time, bulk\\nlaxatives can lower absorption of some drugs. Wow! “Ispaghula may be used during pregnancy\\nand lactation” (CAN). Alcoholic extract is hypotensive in small doses, hypertensive in large\\nP doses (KAP). Mucilage is hypoglycemic. Seeds of related species in China are used clinically\\nto treat high blood pressure with ~50% success. “The FDA has proposed a rule that would amend\\nthe regulation permitting food labeling bearing a health claim on soluble fiber for a lower risk\\nof coronary heart disease (CHD) to include soluble fiber from psyllium husks (Plantago asiatica\\nL.).” The maker of one popular cereal petitioned, citing data from 57 clinical studies (1965–1996,\\nincluding 21 human studies) on psyllium’s ability to lower cholesterol and CHD risk. FASEB\\nhas determined that psyllium is safe at levels up to 25 g/day. FDA counters that high levels of\\npsyllium husk “may enhance epithelial cell proliferation in the GI tract or cause allergies in\\nsome people” (Johnston, B.J.; 1997). FDA proposes health claim for psyllium. HerbalGram\\n41:28.). HH2 reports 8-week clinical trials on hyperuremia with 7 g psyllium husks a day for 8\\nweeks.

Epileptics should be careful with rosemary\\nand other herbs heavy with camphor (CAN). CAN cautions that camphor in the volatile oil may\\ncause convulsions. Michael Castleman is apparently talking about the herb, not the more dan-\\ngerous EO, when he says, “Like most other herbs, rosemary should be used in large amounts\\nonly in consultation with your health care provider. If you are pregnant, you should avoid such\\namounts because they can cause uterine contractions” (Castleman, 1996). The Herbal PDR scares\\nthe pants off us by saying large doses of rosemary leaves (more likely the oil), inadvisedly have\\nbeen used to attempt abortion, may lead to coma, gastroenterosis, nephrosis, pulmonary edema,\\nspasm, uterine bleeding, vomiting, and even to death.

Rosemary oil is effective against opportunistic infections like Cryptococcus\\nneoformans (JBU). Rosemary oil as well as its bornyl acetate and cineole are antispasmodic, on\\nsmooth muscle (guinea pig ileum) and cardiac muscle (guinea pig atria). In smooth muscle,\\nborneol is considered the most active, by antagonizing acetyl choline. The antispasmodic action\\nof rosemary as preceded by contractile action, due to pinenes, which are spasmogenic on smooth\\nmuscle, inactive on cardiac muscle. Rosemary oil relaxes the Oddi’s sphincter contracted by\\nmorphine. Activity increases with incremental oil doses reaching an optimum at 25 mg/kg, at\\nwhich the unblocking effect was immediate. Beyond that dosage, the response was again delayed.\\nSmooth muscle stimulant and analgesic actions have been documented for a rosmaricine deriv-\\native (CAN).\\nROSE-OF-SHARON (Hibiscus syriacus L.) ++\\nActivities (Rose-of-Sharon) — Analgesic (f; FAY); Antibacterial (1; FAY); Antiedemic (f; FAY);\\nAntiinflammatory (f; DAA); Antipyretic (f; FAY); Astringent (f; FAY); Bitter (f; FAY); Carminative\\n(f; DAA); Demulcent (f; FAY; LMP); Detoxicant (f; FAY); Diuretic (f; DAA; FAY; HHB); Emollient\\n(f; LMP); Expectorant (f; FAY; HHB); Fungicide (1; FAY; X739389); Hemostat (f; DAA); Sto-\\nR\\nmachic (f; DAA; HHB); Vermifuge (1; FAY).\\nIndications (Rose-of-Sharon) — Abscess (f; FAY); Ameba (f; DAA); Appendicitis (f; FAY);\\nAscariasis (f; DAA; LMP); Asthma (f; FAY); Athlete’s Foot (f; FAY); Bacteria (1; FAY); Bleeding\\n(f; DAA; FAY; LMP); Boil (f; FAY); Bronchosis (f; FAY); Burn (f; FAY); Cancer (f; ABS; FAY);\\nCarbuncle (f; FAY); Cold (f; DAA); Colitis (f; DAA); Cough (f; FAY); Dermatosis (f; DAA; FAY);\\nDiabetes (f; FAY); Diarrhea (f; FAY; MPI); Dysentery (f; FAY; MPI); Dysmenorrhea (f; DAA;\\nMPI); Dyspepsia (f; LMP); Eczema (f; FAY); Enterosis (f; DAA; LMP); Fever (f; FAY); Fungus\\n(1; FAY; X739389); Gas (f; DAA); Gastrosis (f; DAA); Headache (f; FAY); Hemorrhoid (f; FAY);\\nImpetigo (f; FAY); Infection (1; FAY; X739389); Inflammation (f; DAA); Itch (f; DAA; FAY);\\nLeukorrhea (f; DAA; LMP); Migraine (f; FAY); Mycosis (1; FAY; X739389); Nausea (f; DAA;\\nLMP); Neurodermatosis (f; FAY); Pain (f; FAY); Proctosis (f; FAY); Prolapse (f; FAY); Pulmonosis\\n(f; FAY); Ringworm (f; FAY); Sore (f; FAY); Swelling (f; FAY); Vaginosis (f; FAY); Water Retention\\n(f; DAA; FAY; HHB); Worm (1; DAA; FAY).\\nDosages (Rose-of-Sharon) — 3–9 g dry flowers, 30–60 g fresh flowers (FAY). 3–9 g dry bark;\\n30–60 g fresh root (FAY).\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 633\\nROSE PETALS (Rosa centifolia L.) +++\\nBoth Commission E (KOM) and the Herbal PDR (PH2) aggregate Rosa centifolia L. and R.\\ngallica L. for their account of the rose flower.

CAN reports that safrole in the volatile\\noil is carcinogenic and genotoxic. Because of abortifacient activity of the oil and hepatotoxicity\\nS\\nof safrole, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided. Even safrole-free extracts have\\nreportedly caused tumors. Major symptoms of toxicity include ataxia, depression, and diarrhea,\\nfollowed by death within 4 hours to 7 days. Rats with safrole in their diet at levels of 0.25% to\\n1% exhibit biliary proliferation, growth retardation, liver necrosis, primary hepatomas, stomach\\natrophy, and testicular atrophy. “Sassafras should not be used, internally or externally” (CAN).\\nExtracts (Sassafras) — LD50 of safrole 1950 mg/kg orl rat, 2350 mg/kg orl mus.

High doses may cause\\nspasm followed by paralysis. Safrole reportedly induces both cytochrome P-488 and P-450 activity,\\nand both induces and inhibits hepatic microsomal enzymes, with activity falling after the onset of\\nhepatic toxicity. Putting the risks into perspective, CAN notes that levels of 0.66 mg/kg may prove\\nhazardous to humans, and a cup of tea may provide nearly five times that much. I prefer my\\nperspective based on Bruce Ames’s Herp Index, in which one learns that sassafras tea for its safrole\\nis 1/ th as carcinogenic as beer for its ethanol.\\n13\\n652 Handbook of Medicinal Herbs\\nSASSY BARK, ORDEAL TREE\\n(Erythrophleum suaveolens (Guill. & Perr.)

Bravely, Commission E says no known side effects or contraindications\\n(KOM). A rather heroic herb I do not recommend, like CAN which says, “broom is not suitable\\nfor self medication.” Containing tyramine, it should not be used with MAOIs (KOM). Commission\\nE reports flower contains only low level of alkaloids (major alkaloid sparteine), so that toxic\\nalkaloidal effects should not be expected. Contraindications: hypertension; Interactions: MAOIs\\n(the flower may contain more than 2% of tyramine). And as early as 1938, it was contraindicated\\nin acute nephropathy (MAD). Sparteine was reported as a cardiac depressant (CAN). Also\\ncontraindicated in cardiopathy and high blood pressure. Contraindicated during pregnancy\\n(AEH). Because sparteine is oxytocic, its use in pregnancy and lactation is to be avoided (CAN).\\nHere I see the oft-repeated anomaly, a low dose may have the opposite effect (tachycardic) of\\nhigh doses (bradycardic). Sparteine is more quinidine-like than digitalic, a powerful oxytocic\\nonce used to stimulate uterine constrictions (CAN). Sparteine sulphate can produce respiratory\\narrest (CAN). Sparteine is a negative chronotropic and a negative inotropic. Doses corresponding\\nto >300 mg sparteine (ca. 30 g herb).

Do not take during pregnancy or intense sun exposure\\n(Reichert, 1994; WAM). Commission E reports adverse effect of photosensitivity.

Foster (1996) is moderate, suggesting that St. John’s-Wort should not be mixed with\\nsynthetic antidepressants. Because it may inhibit MAO, taking it with SSRIs, such as Prozac, could\\ncause serious health damage. Although side effects have not been reported in clinical studies, range\\nanimals eating the plant and then standing in bright sunlight have experienced sunburn or blindness\\nfrom photosensitization. This treatment option should be discussed with your health care provider\\n(Foster, 1996). The Herbal PDR state that photodermatosis in animals usually kicks in after high\\ndoses, such as 3000 mg per kg body weight (PHR). CAN cautions that hypericin is phototoxic.\\n“Mice given 0.2–0.5 mg of the herb were found to develop severe photodynamic effects. Delayed\\nhypersensitivity or photodermatosis has been documented for St. John’s-wort, following the inges-\\ntion of a herbal tea made from the leaves” (CAN). ESCOP recommends a limited daily intake of\\n1 mg total hypericin (QRNM, 1997:292). Because of slight uterine activity in vitro, its use in\\npregnancy and lactation is to be avoided (CAN). No contraindications or drug-drug interactions\\nreported (PIP). A recent Internet message cautions about the potential for serotonin syndrome.\\nSymptoms include chills, confusion, fever, myoclonus, hyperactive reflexes, myoclonus, speech\\ndifficulties, and sweating. Cannot be mixed with an SSRI. That is likely to produce serotonin\\nsyndrome—severe headache, tachycardia, and diaphoresis—which resembles neuroleptic malignant\\nsyndrome (O’Brien, 1998). Recently found to detoxify all the same drugs that grapefruit potentiates.\\nIt induces cytochrome P3A4 450, which speeds up metabolism of several drugs. Nierenberg et al.,\\n1999 kindly remind us that, like synthetic antidepressants, this herbal antidepressant may rarely\\ninduce hypomania in manic patients. Poorly designed Loma Linda studies (Ondrizek) suggest that\\nhypericum may interfere with fertility. But this was based on soaking “skinned human sperm” for\\n24 hours in hypericum tea as I recall.\\nS\\nExtracts (St. John’s-Wort) — A StX (600 mg wit, 0.24–0.32% hypericin 3 ×/day) produced\\nerythema in light-sensitive patients (AHP). Leaf extracts enhance mouse immune system against\\nBordetella pertussis and Staphylococcus aureus. Novoimanine is most effective against S.\\naureus, with water soluble imanine being more effective than imamine or sulphanilamide. Herb\\nextracts are reportedly more active against Escherichia, Shigella, and Staphylococcus than\\ndecoctions. Catechin and flavonoid containing fractions inhibit the flu virus 83–100% (CAN).\\nAmentoflavone is antiinflammatory and antiulcerogenic (CAN). Total flavonoid fraction is\\nanalgesic in mice (CAN). Small amounts of hypericin are tonic and tranquilizing in humans\\n(CAN). Extracts inhibit catechol-o-methyl-transferase at 100 µM, modulate interleukin-6, block\\ncorticotropin-releasing hormone, reduce the availability of serotonin receptors (IC50 = 6.2\\nµg/ml) and the associated inhibition of resorption of serotonin into the cell, and block MAO-\\nA and B in vitro and ex vivo, and hypericin raises levels of melatonin, all factors that may\\ncontribute to antidepressant activity. No statistical evidence was shown in the antiinflammatory\\nactivity of the extract and hydrocortisone (QRNM, 1997:292). With rats the IC50 was only 6.2\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 701\\nµg/ml for inhibiting synaptosomal serotonin uptake (consistent with doses of 900 mg extract\\nin humans). LD50 = >5000 mg/kg. Phototoxic reactions occur in some patients with AIDS\\ngiven ivn injections of 30–40 mg hypericin. “Not suitable for use as daily sedatives of sleep\\naids.

Once a well-known published author offered me a generous consulting fee\\nto go through the Spanish and Portuguese literature and summarize the folk literature and\\ninformation on suma for him. I had written on the plant long ago for the Flora of Panama,\\nwhere Pfaffia also occurs. He came from one of the four main entry disciplines to ethnobotany\\nand herbal medicine and medical botany, (1) anthropology, (2) botany, (3) chemistry, and (4)\\npharmacy/pharmacology but I’ll not divulge. I gave him 4 days worth of work and found nothing.\\nHe reneged because my report was negative. Today, that scientist continues to publish, often\\ncopying without citing other ethnobotanical writers’ data. And he is, what I call, one of the\\npaid hypsters who will write a positive opinion page on a worthless herb, for a fee. Then an\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 705\\nunscrupulous pusher will sell that product based on Doctor Hypster’s glittering report, often\\nhanded out as (pseudo) scientific literature based on Dr. Hypster’s world renown. Both hypster\\nand huckster make money while damaging the images of honest herbs and herbalists. And\\nsometimes they threaten those who would expose the lack of credibility of some of those studies.\\nMore recently, I see that an edible plant book describes suma as “Brazilian ginseng” a promo-\\ntional misnomer. “The roots have reportedly been used as a ginseng-like tonic by the Xingu\\ntribe of Matto Grosso, Brazil for at least three hundred years” (FAC).\\nSUMATRA BENZOIN (Styrax paralleloneurum Perkins) ++\\nFew taxonomists know the species of Styrax (as with Boswellia, Commiphora, Picea, and Pinus)\\neven with leaves, fruits, and flowers in hand.

Michael Castleman raises a cautionary flag I don’t\\nremember seeing elsewhere, “Children under age two should not be given medicinal preparations\\nof thyme, and people with thyroid problems should seek their health-care provider’s advice before\\ntaking medicinal doses” (Castleman, 1996). Of course, some people say children under 2 should\\nnot be given any medicine. PHR gives us an EO warning template, “Where large skin injuries\\nor acute skin illnesses, severe feverish or infectious diseases, cardiac insufficiency or hypertonia\\nare present, entire-body baths should be carried out only following consultation with a doctor,\\nno matter what the active agent is” (PHR).

Not covered\\n(CAN; KOM). None at proper dosage (PH2). 150 g tonka beans, cf ~4 g coumarin, might induce\\nheadache, nausea, stupor, and vomiting (PH2). Rats and dogs fed coumarin develop liver damage,\\nretarded growth, and testicular atrophy. In large doses, fluid extracts of tonka beans are reportedly\\ncardioparalytic (APA). The reddish sawdust once caused a workman’s hair, when wetted, to turn bright\\ngreen (CRC). Coumarin can cause severe liver damage “which is why the FDA banned the use of the\\nbeans as a flavoring agent” (APA). Narcotic, the fluid extract can paralyze the heart if infused in large\\ndoses. Respectable scientists question that coumarin, in reasonable doses, can harm humans with normal\\nliver function. Coumarin may possibly cause bleeding incidents, but not like coumadin. Not being\\nexactly exact, APA leads us to a half-coumadinized conclusion: “You may recognize the name coumarin\\nin relation to the common anticoagulant warfarin, sold as Coumadin” (APA). My understanding is that\\nT\\ncoumadin is dicumarol, much more serious than coumarin itself. Coumarin itself (1,2-benzopyrone)\\nhas long-established efficacy in slow-onset, long-term reduction of lymphedema in humans, as con-\\nfirmed in recent double-blind trials against elephantiasis and postmastectomy swelling of the arm. The\\nmechanism of action is uncertain, but may involve macrophage-induced proteolysis of edema protein.\\nHowever, coumarin has low absolute bioavailability in humans (<5%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic\\nconversion to 7-hydroxycoumarin followed by glucuronidation. It may, therefore, be a prodrug (Hoult\\nand Paya Gen Pharmacol 1996; Jun; 27(4):713–22).\\nTORMENTIL, CINQUEFOIL (Potentilla erecta (L.)

Emmenagogue and\\nuterotonic. Contraindicated in patients with bile duct obstruction, gallstones, hyperacidity, and\\nstomach ulcers (AHP; AEH). While in moderate doses, turmeric is said to inhibit cancers, lym-\\nphomas and ulcers, overdoses of curcuminoids may possibly be cytotoxic and ulcerogenic, and\\nmay lead to diminution of red and white corpuscles. Still, Commission E approves 1.5–3 g/day,\\nnot nearly enough to provide 1200 mg curcumin. Commission E also reports contraindications:\\nbiliary obstruction; adverse effects: GI irritation from continued use; consult physicians before\\nusing if a patient has gallstones (BIS; KOM). At 10% of diet, turmeric caused some loss of hair\\nin rats (MAB). Care should be taken in women who wish to conceive or patients complaining of\\nalopecia (MAB). Rather frightening what one reads in UPW (2000): Laboratory animals treated\\nwith it are reported to have been rendered entirely infertile. Women who are pregnant, or children\\n(not yet widely in children) with gallbladder or liver disease or ulcers, should avoid turmeric\\n(WAM). Limit internal use to 10 days (WAM).\\nExtracts (Turmeric) — Fond as I am of synergy and food farmacy, I like the following comments:\\nCurcumin and genistein can inhibit estrogen-positive human breast cells induced by estradiol or\\nT pesticides individually or mixed. Curcumin and genistein were synergistic, totally inhibiting induc-\\ntion in vitro. Curcuminoids inhibit cancer at initiation, promotion and progression in vitro and in\\nvivo (MAB). Viva curried bean soup, like I am having for lunch. Reportedly as effective as\\nhydrocortisone acetate or indomethacin in experimental inflammation (WHO). Both natural anti-\\ninflammatory curcumin (1200 mg/day) and unnatural phenylbutazone (30 mg/day) improved joint\\nswelling, morning stiffness, and walking time in people with rheumatoid arthritis, both better than\\nplacebo (WHO). Bruneton notes that the antiinflammatory ED50 of curcumin orally in rats is 48\\nmg/kg ( = 4.8 g in me) and is apparently devoid of side effects (BRU), while the ipr ED50 is only\\n2.1 mg/kg, suggesting that the ipr route is 20 times more effective. But I am not into injecting\\nherbs. Enjoy your curried beans, counting on those synergies. Duke suggests curcumin needs to\\nbe compared with Celebrex and Vioxx as a COX-2 inhibitor. EO showed significant antihistaminic\\nand antiinflammatory activity, the latter at 0.1 ml/kg, which translates to 10 ml for me, a rather\\ndangerous dose. At a dose of 1.5 g/day/30 days, turmeric reduced urinary excretion of mutagens\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 743\\nin an uncontrolled trial of 16 chronic smokers. In six nonsmoking controls there was no change in\\nurinary secretion. Turmeric had no effect on serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino\\ntransferase, blood glucose, creatinine, and lipid profile (MAB). Turmeric extract (~20 mg cur-\\ncumin/day) for 45 days dramatically decreased blood lipid peroxide levels in 18 male subjects\\n(MAB). Curcumin is poorly absorbed (some 15–35% max in rats) orally but if administered with\\npiperine (from black and long pepper), absorption is improved more than 150% in rats. But in\\nhuman volunteers, 20 mg piperine increases bioavailability of curcumin 20-fold (MAB). One study\\nindicated curcumin and sodium curcuminate were more potent than phenylbutazone in acute and\\nchronic arthritic models, while another found it only 1/ th as effective as ibuprofen. While ulcero-\\n10\\ngenic in large doses, curcumin is only about one-third as ulcerogenic as the phenylbutazone. In\\nlow doses, curcumin had antiulcer activity, protecting against the ulcerogenic activity of phenylb-\\nutazone (MAB). 1-Phenylhydroxy-N-pentane stimulates the secretion of secretin, gastrin and bicar-\\nbonate, helping maintain the gastric pH in dogs and humans (TRA). LD50 ether extracts 12,200\\nmg/kg orl rat (MAB), LDlo curcumin >2000 mg/kg orl mus (MAB), LDlo curcumin >5000 mg/kg\\norl rat (MAB).\\nT\\nU\\nUNICORN ROOT (Aletris farinosa L.) +\\nActivities (Unicorn Root) — Antiinflammatory (1; FAD); Carminative (f; CRC); Diuretic (f; CRC);\\nEmetic (f; CRC; GMH); Emmenagogue (f; DEM); Estrogenic (1; CRC; HH2; PHR; PNC); Laxative\\n(f; CRC; GMH); Narcotic (f; CRC; GMH); Sedative (f; CRC); Stomachic (f; CRC; PNC); Tonic\\n(f; PH2; PNC); Vermifuge (f; CRC).\\nIndications (Unicorn Root) — Abortion (f; CRC); Ague (f; CRC); Amenorrhea (f; PHR; PH2);\\nAnasarca (f; CRC); Anorexia (f; PH2; PNC); Backache (f; CRC); Bronchosis (f; PH2); Chlorosis\\n(f; CRC); Colic (f; CRC); Constipation (f; CRC; GMH); Cough (f; CRC); Debility (f; PNC);\\nDiarrhea (f; FAD); Dysentery (f; CRC); Dysmenorrhea (f; CRC; PHR; PH2); Dyspepsia (f; CRC;\\nPH2; PNC); Dysuria (f; CRC); Enterosis (f; PH2); Fever (f; CRC; DEM); Gas (f; CRC; PH2);\\nGastrosis (f; CRC; PH2); Hysteria (f; CRC; DEM; PH2); Inflammation (1; FAD); Insomnia (f;\\nCRC); Jaundice (f; CRC; FAD); Miscarriage (f; CRC); Nervousness (f; CRC); Neurosis (f; PH2);\\nProlapse (f; PHR; PH2); Pulmonosis (f; CRC); Rheumatism (f; CRC; FAD); Sore (f; CRC);\\nStomachache (f; CRC); Strangury (f; CRC); Tuberculosis (f; DEM); Uterosis (f; CRC); Vaginosis\\n(f; PHR; PH2); Water Retention (f; CRC); Womb (f; CRC); Worm (f; CRC).\\nDosages (Unicorn Root) — 1.5 g herb/100 ml water (PH2); 0.3–0.6 g powdered root (PNC); 0.3–1\\nml liquid extract (PNC); 2–4 ml herb elixir (PNC).\\nContraindications, Interactions, and Side Effects (Unicorn Root) — Class 2d (AHP).

Ironically, “There is some concern about continual use, which may cause minor side\\neffects, including headaches, excitability, and insomnia” (Morazzoni & Bombardelli, 1995).\\nAHP minimizes published concern about toxicity of valepotriates, due to poor absorption and\\nquick degradation into less toxic metabolites. If we accept this, we have to minimize medicinal\\npotential of the valepotriates as well. CAN says, “There have been no reported side effects to\\nvalerian. The oil is unlikely to present any hazard in aromatherapy” (CAN). After all those kind\\nwords CAN says, “The safety of valerian during pregnancy and lactation has not been established\\nV\\nand should, therefore, be avoided.” CNS depressant activity may potentiate pharmaceutical\\nsedatives (CAN).

Salicylates and\\ntannins (AHP). AHP gives wintergreen its top score for efficacy (APA). “Not allowed as a non-\\nmedicinal ingredient in oral products in Canada” (Michols, 1995). As little as 4 ml wintergreen\\noil can be lethal to an infant. In the U.S., liquid preparations containing more than 5 ml methyl\\nsalicylate must be in child-resistant packaging. Mothers are advised that salicylates do enter\\nbreast milk. Some people, especially asthmatics, may be supersensitive to salicylates. Caution\\nis always indicated when ingesting any new substance, natural or synthetic (AEH). Wintergreen\\noil, classified as “very toxic,” contains methyl salicylate as the chief constituent. Poisoning from\\nwintergreen oil can cause acid-base imbalance, altered glucose metabolism, and central nervous\\nsystem toxicity. Between 5 ml and 30 ml of wintergreen oil is considered the lethal dose for a\\n70 kg human. CNS symptoms of mild chronic salicylate toxicity include headache, dizziness,\\ntinnitus, difficulty in hearing, dimness of vision, mental confusion, lassitude, and drowsiness.\\nMore severe symptoms include seizures and coma. Fever is usually prominent. Severe acute\\nsalicylism includes disorientation, irritability, hallucinations, lethargy, stupor, coma, and seizures.\\nGI irritation may produce nausea and vomiting, hyperventilation, increased GI losses leading to\\nmild dehydration, which is enhanced by decreased intake of fluid. Hypokalemia may result from\\nincreased GI and renal losses and systemic alkalosis (AEH1). The prodrug, salicin, which does\\nnot irritate the stomach, is metabolized to saligenin in the GI tract and salicylic acid after\\nabsorption. “Products containing willow should preferably be standardized on their salicin\\ncontent...” (CAN).

Unapproved by KOM. “Since the effectiveness for\\nthe claimed applications is not documented, a therapeutic use of this herb cannot be recommended”\\n(KOM). I feel that it can serve in lieu of cardamom, ginger, and/or turmeric because it shares many\\nof the same chemicals with them. In India, it is even recommended for infants and convalescents.\\nNot for use during pregnancy (PH2). Containing up to 0.1% curcumin, this, like turmeric and\\nginger, may be viewed as a COX-2 inhibitor, of potential use in Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, and\\ncancer. Curcumol and curdione are regarded in the Orient as effective anticancer compounds,\\nespecially for cervical cancer and lymphosarcoma.\\nZ\\nReference Abbreviations\\n(Book and journal abbreviations)\\n60P Desmarchelier and Witting Schaus (2000)\\nAAB Arvigo and Balick (1993)\\nAAR Arndt (1999)\\nABS Siquera et al.

Commission E and other sources report interaction of anthranoid laxatives (AEH).\\nAnthranoid-containing laxatives can be habit-forming. Some contain compounds suspected of\\nbeing cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and even tumorigenic. Epidemiological studies in\\nGermany reveal that abusers of anthranoid laxatives have three times higher rate of colon\\ncarcinoma. One woman developed clubbing of her digits and hypertropic osteoarthropathy\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 9\\nafter taking at least three tablets daily for 3 years for weight loss. She also experienced several\\nA\\nmonths of secondary amenorrhea. Of senna leaf, Blumenthal et al. lists abdominal pain of\\nunknown origin, acute intestinal inflammation (e.g., Crohn’s disease and colitis ulcerosa), and\\nappendicitis as contraindications. Because of the anthraquinones, nonstandardized preparations\\nshould be avoided during pregnancy and lactation (CAN). “Anthraquinones may be secreted\\ninto breast milk” (CAN). Should not be used in lactation, pregnancy, or with children under\\n12 years old (KOM). Occasional cramp-like discomfort of the GI tract may require dosage\\nreduction (KOM). Side effects with chronic abuse: disturbance of electrolyte balance, espe-\\ncially hypokalemia (may be exacerbated by simultaneous administration of corticoadrenal\\nsteroids, licorice root, or thiazide diuretics), leading to cardiopathy, muscular weakness espe-\\ncially with concurrent uses of cardiac glycosides, corticosteroids, or diuretics (KOM). Pig-\\nmentation of the intestinal mucosae (pseudomelanosis coli) is harmless and usually reverses\\non discontinuation of the drug. Laxative like this should not be used more than 1–2 weeks\\nwithout medical advice (KOM). CAN report anthraquinones are purgative and irritate GI tract.\\nAlso contraindicated in hemorrhoids and nephropathy (CAN), intestinal obstruction, abdominal\\npain of unknown causes, any enterosis (appendicitis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome) hemorrhoids, nephropathy, menstruation (AHP). Do not use more than 8–10 days\\n(AHP). Do not use this in case of abdominal pain or diarrhea. Consult a health care provider\\nprior to use in pregnancy or nursing. Discontinue use if diarrhea or watery stools occur. Not\\nfor long term use (AHP). “Some herbal laxative preparations, such as cascara and senna for\\nexample, can cause an increase in the potency of digoxin” (D’epiro, 1997). Pedersen)\\ncautions against taking the fresh leaf (we have done that in Peru with modest laxative results).\\n“Senna causes gripping unless taken in combination with carminative herbs such as ginger,\\ncloves, or various mint species.” Although GRAS, senna can be more habit-forming than\\ncascara (PED). Lininger et al.) pronounce it “safe for children over the age of six” (half\\nthe adult dose) (SKY). I’d be more cautious.\\nExtracts (Alexandrian Senna) — Possibly representing a negative case for my synergy\\nproposition, “The toxicity of total extracts is greater than that of the individual sennosides. It\\nhas been proposed that the laxative and toxic components of senna could be separated” (CAN).\\nElsewhere, I have read that the sennosides are synergetic as far as their laxative action is\\nconcerned. But then anomalously, CAN report that sennosides A and B are reported to be most\\npotent with respect to laxative action, but the least toxic compared to other anthraquinone\\nfractions. LD50s of sennosides A & B are 4100 mg/kg ivn mus and of rhein-8-glycoside 400\\nmg/kg ivn mus.

Some contain compounds suspected of\\nbeing cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and even tumorigenic. Epidemiological studies in\\nGermany reveal that abusers of anthranoid laxatives have three times higher rate of colon\\ncarcinoma. One woman developed clubbing of her digits and hypertropic osteoarthropathy\\nHandbook of Medicinal Herbs 9\\nafter taking at least three tablets daily for 3 years for weight loss. She also experienced several\\nA\\nmonths of secondary amenorrhea. Of senna leaf, Blumenthal et al. lists abdominal pain of\\nunknown origin, acute intestinal inflammation (e.g., Crohn’s disease and colitis ulcerosa), and\\nappendicitis as contraindications. Because of the anthraquinones, nonstandardized preparations\\nshould be avoided during pregnancy and lactation (CAN). “Anthraquinones may be secreted\\ninto breast milk” (CAN). Should not be used in lactation, pregnancy, or with children under\\n12 years old (KOM). Occasional cramp-like discomfort of the GI tract may require dosage\\nreduction (KOM). Side effects with chronic abuse: disturbance of electrolyte balance, espe-\\ncially hypokalemia (may be exacerbated by simultaneous administration of corticoadrenal\\nsteroids, licorice root, or thiazide diuretics), leading to cardiopathy, muscular weakness espe-\\ncially with concurrent uses of cardiac glycosides, corticosteroids, or diuretics (KOM). Pig-\\nmentation of the intestinal mucosae (pseudomelanosis coli) is harmless and usually reverses\\non discontinuation of the drug. Laxative like this should not be used more than 1–2 weeks\\nwithout medical advice (KOM). CAN report anthraquinones are purgative and irritate GI tract.\\nAlso contraindicated in hemorrhoids and nephropathy (CAN), intestinal obstruction, abdominal\\npain of unknown causes, any enterosis (appendicitis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome) hemorrhoids, nephropathy, menstruation (AHP). Do not use more than 8–10 days\\n(AHP). Do not use this in case of abdominal pain or diarrhea. Consult a health care provider\\nprior to use in pregnancy or nursing. Discontinue use if diarrhea or watery stools occur. Not\\nfor long term use (AHP). “Some herbal laxative preparations, such as cascara and senna for\\nexample, can cause an increase in the potency of digoxin” (D’epiro, 1997). Pedersen)\\ncautions against taking the fresh leaf (we have done that in Peru with modest laxative results).\\n“Senna causes gripping unless taken in combination with carminative herbs such as ginger,\\ncloves, or various mint species.” Although GRAS, senna can be more habit-forming than\\ncascara (PED). Lininger et al.) pronounce it “safe for children over the age of six” (half\\nthe adult dose) (SKY). I’d be more cautious.\\nExtracts (Alexandrian Senna) — Possibly representing a negative case for my synergy\\nproposition, “The toxicity of total extracts is greater than that of the individual sennosides. It\\nhas been proposed that the laxative and toxic components of senna could be separated” (CAN).\\nElsewhere, I have read that the sennosides are synergetic as far as their laxative action is\\nconcerned. But then anomalously, CAN report that sennosides A and B are reported to be most\\npotent with respect to laxative action, but the least toxic compared to other anthraquinone\\nfractions. LD50s of sennosides A & B are 4100 mg/kg ivn mus and of rhein-8-glycoside 400\\nmg/kg ivn mus.

She also experienced several\\nA\\nmonths of secondary amenorrhea. Of senna leaf, Blumenthal et al. lists abdominal pain of\\nunknown origin, acute intestinal inflammation (e.g., Crohn’s disease and colitis ulcerosa), and\\nappendicitis as contraindications. Because of the anthraquinones, nonstandardized preparations\\nshould be avoided during pregnancy and lactation (CAN). “Anthraquinones may be secreted\\ninto breast milk” (CAN). Should not be used in lactation, pregnancy, or with children under\\n12 years old (KOM). Occasional cramp-like discomfort of the GI tract may require dosage\\nreduction (KOM). Side effects with chronic abuse: disturbance of electrolyte balance, espe-\\ncially hypokalemia (may be exacerbated by simultaneous administration of corticoadrenal\\nsteroids, licorice root, or thiazide diuretics), leading to cardiopathy, muscular weakness espe-\\ncially with concurrent uses of cardiac glycosides, corticosteroids, or diuretics (KOM). Pig-\\nmentation of the intestinal mucosae (pseudomelanosis coli) is harmless and usually reverses\\non discontinuation of the drug. Laxative like this should not be used more than 1–2 weeks\\nwithout medical advice (KOM). CAN report anthraquinones are purgative and irritate GI tract.\\nAlso contraindicated in hemorrhoids and nephropathy (CAN), intestinal obstruction, abdominal\\npain of unknown causes, any enterosis (appendicitis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome) hemorrhoids, nephropathy, menstruation (AHP). Do not use more than 8–10 days\\n(AHP). Do not use this in case of abdominal pain or diarrhea. Consult a health care provider\\nprior to use in pregnancy or nursing. Discontinue use if diarrhea or watery stools occur. Not\\nfor long term use (AHP). “Some herbal laxative preparations, such as cascara and senna for\\nexample, can cause an increase in the potency of digoxin” (D’epiro, 1997). Pedersen)\\ncautions against taking the fresh leaf (we have done that in Peru with modest laxative results).\\n“Senna causes gripping unless taken in combination with carminative herbs such as ginger,\\ncloves, or various mint species.” Although GRAS, senna can be more habit-forming than\\ncascara (PED). Lininger et al.) pronounce it “safe for children over the age of six” (half\\nthe adult dose) (SKY). I’d be more cautious.\\nExtracts (Alexandrian Senna) — Possibly representing a negative case for my synergy\\nproposition, “The toxicity of total extracts is greater than that of the individual sennosides. It\\nhas been proposed that the laxative and toxic components of senna could be separated” (CAN).\\nElsewhere, I have read that the sennosides are synergetic as far as their laxative action is\\nconcerned.
