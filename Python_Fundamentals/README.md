Mini Report — Week 1 Findings
1. Dataset Overview

Total number of samples: 100

Number of species: 4

Arabidopsis thaliana

Oryza sativa

Solanum lycopersicum

Zea mays

2. pH Distribution

Samples were categorized into acidic, neutral, and basic groups based on pH values.

The stem sample type recorded the highest number of acidic observations.

This suggests that stem samples tend to have lower pH values compared to other sample types.

3. Sample Weights

Mean sample weights differed across species.

Arabidopsis thaliana had the highest mean weight at 290.61 mg.

Solanum lycopersicum had the lowest mean weight, averaging 211.53 mg.

4. Tasks Completed

Loaded and inspected the sample dataset

Performed filtering, grouping, and feature creation

Created clean exported datasets (CSV files)

Generated summary tables

Produced basic visualizations (histogram + grouped bar chart)
