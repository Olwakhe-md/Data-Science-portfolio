    "2. pH Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples were categorized into acidic, neutral, and basic groups based on pH values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stem sample type recorded the highest number of acidic observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that stem samples tend to have lower pH values compared to other sample types.\n",

    "3. Sample Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean sample weights differed across species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arabidopsis thaliana had the highest mean weight at 290.61 mg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solanum lycopersicum had the lowest mean weight, averaging 211.53 mg.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tasks Completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Loaded and inspected the sample dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Performed filtering, grouping, and feature creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Created clean exported datasets (CSV files)\n",
