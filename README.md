🌱 Data Science Portfolio — Mdumiseni Ndlovu

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. 
This repository documents my not so structured journey(as I self teach myself, too many pitfalls) into Data Science with a focus on biology, biochemistry, and real-world applied analysis.
Each week contains a guided project designed to build strong foundational skills through practical, portfolio-ready work.

🚀 About Me

I am a biochemistry graduate with a strong interest in:

🧬 Biological data analysis

🌱 Agricultural and plant science analytics

🤖 Machine learning for health and biotech

📊 Data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling

This portfolio reflects my progression from beginner-level Python skills to advanced data science tools and machine learning techniques — all applied to real biological datasets.

📂 Portfolio Structure

The repository is organized into modules that build on top of each other:

data-science-portfolio/
│
├── Python_Fundamentals/
├── Data_Cleaning/
├── SQL/
├── KNIME/
├── Visualization/
├── Project_Building/
└── 


Each folder contains:

🔹 A Jupyter notebook

🔹 Cleaned datasets

🔹 Summary tables

🔹 Visualizations

🔹 A project README

🔹 A mini-report of findings


📘 Current Progress
