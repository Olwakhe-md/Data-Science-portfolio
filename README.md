🌱 Data Science Portfolio — Mdumiseni Ndlovu

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio.
This repository documents my structured journey into Data Science with a focus on biology, biochemistry, and real-world applied analysis.
Each week contains a guided project designed to build strong foundational skills through practical, portfolio-ready work.

🚀 About Me

I am a biochemistry graduate with a strong interest in:

🧬 Biological data analysis

🌱 Agricultural and plant science analytics

🤖 Machine learning for health and biotech

📊 Data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling

This portfolio reflects my progression from beginner-level Python skills to advanced data science tools and machine learning techniques — all applied to real biological datasets.

📂 Portfolio Structure

The repository is organized into weekly modules:

data-science-portfolio/
│
├── Week1_Python_Fundamentals/
├── Week2_Data_Cleaning/
├── Week3_SQL/
├── Week4_KNIME/
├── Week5_Visualization/
├── Week6_Project_Building/
└── 


Each week folder contains:

🔹 A Jupyter notebook

🔹 Cleaned datasets

🔹 Summary tables

🔹 Visualizations

🔹 A project README

🔹 A mini-report of findings


📘 Current Progress
✅ Week 1 — Python Fundamentals

Loaded and explored a biological dataset

Performed filtering, grouping, and feature creation

Built custom features like pH_category and weight_grams

Generated basic visualizations (histograms, grouped bar charts)

Wrote a structured mini-report summarizing findings

Published work to GitHub using Git version control

📁 Folder: Week1_Python_Fundamentals
