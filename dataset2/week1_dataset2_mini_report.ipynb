    "#Mini Report — Dataset 2: Herbal Plant Samples\n",
    "1. **Dataset Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of samples: 120\n",
    "\n",
    "Species included:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Mentha spicata***\n",
    "\n",
    "***Rosmarinus officinalis***\n",
    "\n",
    "***Lavandula angustifolia***\n",
    "\n",
    "***Curcuma longa***\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample types: leaf, root, stem, flower\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: weight_mg, pH, sample_type, pH_category, weight_grams\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **pH Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Acidic samples: 70\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral samples: 21\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic samples: 29\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample type with the highest acidic count: root\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brief interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    " \"Root samples showed a higher proportion of acidic readings, suggesting possible biochemical variation and composition in extraction mixtures.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weight Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Species with highest mean weight: ***Curcuma longa*** (427.81 mg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Species with lowest mean weight: ***Rosmarinus officinalis*** (386.61 mg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notable pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Rosmarinus samples tended to be lighter across sample types, while Curcuma had more heavy samples.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crosstab Summary (Sample Type × pH Category)**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Rosmarinus officinalis*** had the highest percentage of acidic samples, with a low marginal difference. \n",
    "Generaly all species showed a higher percentage of acidic species as compared to the other pH categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Histogram of pH:**\n",
    "-The pH distribution shows two peaks: one around pH 5 (acidic) and another near pH 8 (basic). Neutral samples were relatively fewer. \n",
    "-This suggests that the herbal samples tend to fall into either acidic or basic pH ranges, with acidic samples being slightly more dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Grouped bar chart:**\n",
    "All four species have similar average weights (≈ 380–430 mg).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, two species stand out slightly:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Curcuma longa*** (leftmost) appears to have the highest mean weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Lavandula angustifolia*** looks slightly lower but still close to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Outlier Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria for outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "weight_mg > 700\n",
    "\n",
    "OR pH < 4.5\n",
    "\n",
    "OR pH > 8.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Report:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of outliers: 37\n",
    "\n",
    "species that  had the most outliers: \n",
    "Lavandula angustifolia    10\n",
    "Rosmarinus officinalis    10\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Lavundula*** and ***Rosmarinus*** had the most heavy outliers due to naturally dense rhizome samples.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Stability Index Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "stability_index = weight_grams * pH\n",
    "\n",
    "root samples showed a high stability index.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Root samples showed higher stability indices, possibly due to their higher biomass and consistent pH.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "⭐ 9. Overall Insights & Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "“Root samples tended to show the widest pH variation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lavundula species consistently had heavier samples and higher stability indices.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lavender shows a shift toward higher pH, making it the least acidic species.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The dataset behaved biologically realistically, supporting valid interpretation.”\n",
    "\n",
